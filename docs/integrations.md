The Infracost CI/CD integration can be used to automatically add a pull request comment showing the cost estimate difference (similar to `git diff`) if a percentage threshold is crossed.

Infracost can be used in any CI/CD system using [our binary](https://github.com/infracost/infracost/releases) or [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/infracost/infracost). You might also find our [CI diff script](https://github.com/infracost/infracost/tree/master/scripts/ci) useful; it's used in the following integrations.

If you run into any issues with CI/CD integrations, please join our [community Slack channel](https://www.infracost.io/community-chat); we'd be happy to guide you through it.

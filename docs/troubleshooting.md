Please try the following troubleshooting steps and if they don't help, either [create an issue](https://github.com/infracost/infracost/issues/new/choose) or join our [community Slack channel](https://www.infracost.io/community-chat) - we'll help you very quickly ðŸ˜„ðŸš€

## 1. Enable additional logging

If the Infracost CLI fails, re-run it with `--log-level=debug` or the `INFRACOST_LOG_LEVEL=debug` environment variable in case that provides helpful details.

If the Terraform CLI fails, check their [debugging page](https://www.terraform.io/internals/debugging) for help. Likewise, if the Terragrunt CLI fails, check their [debugging page](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/debugging/) for help.

## 2. Generating plan JSON files

By default, the Infracost CLI parses Terraform HCL code to estimate costs. If that does not work for your use-case, or you already have a Terraform plan JSON file, Infracost can also parse that. See the relevant [Terraform CLI](#terraform-cli), [Terraform Cloud](#terraform-cloud) or [Terragrunt](#terragrunt) sections below on how to generate plans. These bash scripts can be modified and used in your CI/CD pipelines.

### Terraform CLI

The Terraform CLI can be used to produce a plan JSON file as shown below:

#### Single project

```bash
cd path/to/code
terraform init

# Customize this to how you run Terraform
# e.g. if you are using variables you can pass them with -var or -var-file
terraform plan -out tfplan.binary
terraform show -json tfplan.binary > plan.json

infracost breakdown --path plan.json
```

#### Multi-projects

We recommend that you use an Infracost [config file](/docs/features/config_file/) to define paths to the projects plan JSON files. If that doesn't work for your use-case, you can use the following bash script to generate Terraform plan JSON files, dynamically create a config file and pass it to Infracost.

```bash
# Path to Terraform code
TF_ROOT=path/to/code

cd $TF_ROOT

# Find all subfolders that have .tf files, but exclude "modules" folders, can be customized
tfprojects=($(find . -type f -name '*.tf' | sed -E 's|/[^/]+$||' | grep -v modules | sort -u))

plans=()
planjsons=()
for project in "${tfprojects[@]}"; do
  # You can remove this if Terraform is already init'd
  echo "Running terraform init for $project"
  terraform -chdir=$project init

  # Customize this to how you run Terraform
  # e.g. if you are using variables you can pass them with -var or -var-file
  echo "Running terraform plan for $project"
  terraform -chdir=$project plan -out tfplan.binary

  echo "Running terraform show for $project"
  terraform -chdir=$project show -json tfplan.binary > $project/plan.json

  plans=(${plans[@]} "$project/tfplan.binary")
  planjsons=(${planjsons[@]} "$project/plan.json")
done

# Generate Infracost config file
echo -e "version: 0.1\n\nprojects:\n" > infracost-generated.yml
for planjson in "${planjsons[@]}"; do
  echo -e "  - path: $planjson" >> infracost-generated.yml
done

# Infracost CLI commands can be run now
infracost breakdown --config-file=infracost-generated.yml

# Cleanup generated files
rm infracost-generated.yml
rm $plans
rm $planjsons
```

### Terraform Cloud

When Terraform Cloud/Enterprise's [remote execution mode](https://www.terraform.io/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings#execution-mode) is used, the Terraform CLI doesn't allow you to save the plan output directly. Thus the following bash script is needed to fetch the plan JSON from Terraform Cloud:

```bash
# Path to Terraform code
TF_ROOT=path/to/code
# If you're using Terraform Enterprise update this to your Terraform enterprise hostname (without https://)
TFC_HOST=app.terraform.io
# Create a Team API Token or User API Token that can be used to fetch the plan, see https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/users-teams-organizations/api-tokens.html
TFC_TOKEN=my_token_here

# This file is used by the Terraform CLI to authenticate with Terraform Cloud, it might also live in /root/.terraformrc on Linux CI/CD machines
cp ~/.terraformrc ~/.terraformrc.old
cat <<EOF > /root/.terraformrc
credentials "$TFC_HOST" {
  token = "$TFC_TOKEN"
}
EOF

cd $TF_ROOT

# You can remove this if Terraform is already init'd
echo "Running terraform init"
terraform init

# When using TFC remote execution, terraform doesn't allow us to save the plan output.
# So we have to save the plan logs so we can parse out the run ID and fetch the plan JSON
echo "Running terraform plan"
terraform plan -no-color | tee /tmp/plan_logs.txt

echo "Retrieving the plan JSON"
# Parse the run URL and ID from the logs
run_url=$(grep -A1 'To view this run' /tmp/plan_logs.txt | tail -n 1)
run_id=$(basename $run_url)

# Get the run plan response and parse out the path to the plan JSON
run_plan_resp=$(wget -q -O - --header="Authorization: Bearer $TFC_TOKEN" "https://$TFC_HOST/api/v2/runs/$run_id/plan")
plan_json_path=$(echo $run_plan_resp | sed 's/.*\"json-output\":\"\([^\"]*\)\".*/\1/')

# Download the plan JSON
wget -q -O plan.json --header="Authorization: Bearer $TFC_TOKEN" "https://$TFC_HOST$plan_json_path"

# Infracost CLI commands can be run now
infracost breakdown --path plan.json

# Cleanup generated files
rm /tmp/plan_logs.txt
rm plan.json
```

### Terragrunt

If the built-in [CLI integration with Terragrunt](/docs/features/terragrunt/#how-the-terragrunt-integration-works) does not work for your use-case, we recommend using/customizing the following bash script. This is required as Terragrunt does not provide a quick way of creating a Terraform plan JSON file for the whole project.

```bash
# Path to Terraform code
TF_ROOT=path/to/code

cd $TF_ROOT

# Generate plan JSON files for all Terragrunt modules and add them to an Infracost config file
terragrunt run-all --terragrunt-ignore-external-dependencies plan -out tfplan.binary

# Find the plan files
plans=($(find . -name tfplan.binary))

# Generate plan JSON files by running terragrunt show for each plan file
planjsons=()
for plan in "${plans[@]}"; do
  # Find the Terraform working directory for running terragrunt show
  # We want to take the dir of the plan file and strip off anything after the .terraform-cache dir
  # to find the location of the Terraform working directory that contains the Terraform code
  dir=$(dirname $plan)
  dir=$(echo "$dir" | sed 's/\(.*\)\/\.terragrunt-cache\/.*/\1/')

  # Customize this to how you run Terragrunt
  echo "Running terragrunt show for $(basename $plan) for $dir"
  terragrunt show -json $(basename $plan) --terragrunt-working-dir=$dir --terragrunt-no-auto-init > $dir/plan.json
  planjsons=(${planjsons[@]} "$dir/plan.json")
done

# Sort the plan JSONs so we get consistent project ordering in the config file
IFS=$'\n' planjsons=($(sort <<<"${planjsons[*]}"))

# Generate Infracost config file
echo -e "version: 0.1\n\nprojects:\n" > infracost-generated.yml
for planjson in "${planjsons[@]}"; do
  echo -e "  - path: $planjson" >> infracost-generated.yml
done

# Infracost CLI commands can be run now
infracost breakdown --config-file=infracost-generated.yml

# Cleanup generated files
rm infracost-generated.yml
rm $plans
rm $planjsons
```

## 3. Check supported versions

Check the Terraform version matches what you expect. Infracost works with Terraform v0.12 and above.
Use `ls -lah` in the CI build to check for any `.terraform*` files/folders that might be confusing Terraform running in CI vs previous runs that were used to create them. Removing those files might help.

## 4. Combining plan JSON files

Once you have multiple Terraform plan JSON files, you can
1. run [`infracost breakdown`](/docs/features/cli_commands/#breakdown) with `--path plan-1.json --format json --out-file infracost-1.json` to generate an Infracost JSON file for each.
2. run [`infracost output`](/docs/features/cli_commands/#combined-output-formats) with `--path "infracost-*.json" --format diff` (glob patterns need quotes) to combine the Infracost JSON files into one output format. The `infracost output --help` command shows the other options.

These steps are used by our [CI/CD integrations](/docs/#4-add-to-cicd) to post pull request comments.

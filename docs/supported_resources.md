title: Supported resources
---

The quickest way to find out if your Terraform resources are supported is to [run Infracost](/docs#usage-methods) with the `--show-skipped` option. This shows the unsupported resources, some of which might be free.

Infracost currently supports the following Terraform resources.

### Amazon Web Services (AWS)

On-demand prices are used. In some cases, AWS Spot prices are also supported, but AWS Reserved Instance prices are not supported since it is difficult to tell from Terraform resources whether they could be utilized.

| Service name | Main Terraform resources      | Notes |

### Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

| Service name | Main Terraform resources      | Notes |
| ---          | ---                           | ---   |
| Compute Engine | `google_compute_instance`, `google_compute_disk`, `google_compute_address`, `google_compute_global_address` | Sustained use discounts are applied to monthly costs, but not to hourly costs.

### The resource I want isn't supported

We're regularly adding support for new resources - be sure to [watch the repo](https://github.com/infracost/infracost/) for new releases. You can help by:
1. [Creating an issue](https://github.com/infracost/infracost/issues/new/choose) and mentioning the resource you need and a little about your use-case; we'll try to prioritize it depending on the community feedback.
2. [Contributing to Infracost](https://github.com/infracost/infracost#contributing). You can join our [community Slack channel](https://www.infracost.io/community-chat) if you need help contributing. We're looking for people to help us add new AWS and Google resources and are willing to pay for that. Please direct-message Ali Khajeh-Hosseini on our community Slack channel to find out more!

We plan to add support for more cloud vendors ([Azure](https://github.com/infracost/infracost/issues/64)) and other IaC tools ([Pulumi](https://github.com/infracost/infracost/issues/187), [CloudFormation](https://github.com/infracost/infracost/issues/190)) too. Please watch and üëç them if you'd like us to work on them sooner.

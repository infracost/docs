title: Supported resources
---

The quickest way to find out if your Terraform resources are supported is to run [`infracost breakdown`](/docs#usage) with the `--show-skipped` flag. This shows the unsupported resources, some of which might be free.

You could also run the following command to only see the unsupported resources: `infracost breakdown --format=json --log-level=warn | jq ".summary.unsupportedResourceCounts"`.

Infracost supports the following Terraform resources. We do not take into account free tiers that apply to some resources as it can be difficult to detect which accounts they apply to; you can still see costs going up or down based on changes since we're consistent.

### Amazon Web Services (AWS)

On-demand prices are used by default unless specified otherwise in the [usage file](/docs/usage_based_resources#infracost-usage-file). GovCloud regions are also supported.

### The resource I want isn't supported

We regularly add support for new resources so we recommend watching our repo for releases: goto the [repo](https://github.com/infracost/infracost) page, click on the Watch button > select Custom > Releases and click on Apply.

You can help by:
1. [Creating an issue](https://github.com/infracost/infracost/issues/new/choose) and mentioning the resource names you need; we'll try to prioritize it depending on the community feedback.
2. [Contributing to Infracost](https://github.com/infracost/infracost#contributing). You can join our [community Slack channel](https://www.infracost.io/community-chat) if you need help contributing.

We plan to add support for other IaC tools such as [Pulumi](https://github.com/infracost/infracost/issues/187) and [CloudFormation](https://github.com/infracost/infracost/issues/190). Please üëç them if you'd like us to work on them sooner.

Follow this page to migrate from our old [infracost_atlantis_diff.sh bash script](https://github.com/infracost/infracost-atlantis/blob/c510d9d8c3f8d226be1d0882d95f3f477b3fe058/README.md) to our new [Azure DevOps Extension](https://github.com/infracost/infracost-atlantis).

## What's new?

üöÄ The new [Infracost Atlantis integration](https://github.com/infracost/infracost-atlantis) provides a set of examples for using Infracost in your Atlantis workflows. We've also updated our `infracost/infracost-atlantis` Docker images to tag the versions of Atlantis and Infracost. You can now add a separate Infracost comment to your pull request with a cost summary table, and different behaviors, so you can control when comments are posted.

### Docker images

We provide pre-built Docker images that extend the official Atlantis image and include Infracost. We maintain tags for the latest two 0.x versions of Atlantis:

* `infracost/infracost-atlantis:atlantis0.18-infracost0.9` latest patch version of Atlantis v0.18 and Infracost v0.9
* `infracost/infracost-atlantis:atlantis0.17-infracost0.9` latest patch version of Atlantis v0.17 and Infracost v0.9
* `infracost/infracost-atlantis:latest` latest versions of Atlantis and Infracost

If you already use a custom Docker image for Atlantis, copy the RUN commands from [this Dockerfile](https://github.com/infracost/infracost-atlantis/blob/master/Dockerfile) into your Dockerfile.

### Separate comments

As shown in the screenshot at the top of this page, a separate Infracost comment is posted to show the total cost diff for any projects that have changed alongside the Atlantis comment.

This uses the new `infracost comment` command to generate and post the comment. [Our examples](https://github.com/infracost/infracost-atlantis/tree/master/infracost-atlantis/#examples) show how to use this wth different GitHub, GitLab and Azure Repos.

If you are using Atlantis with BitBucket, please üëç [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/infracost/infracost/issues/1173) so you get a notification when we support it.

#### Comment behaviors

The `infracost comment` command has a `behavior` flag which can be used to describe how and when comments should be posted; we support four options:
- `new`: Create a new cost estimate comment. Pull request followers will be notified on each comment. This is the option we recommend for Atlantis, since by default Atlantis posts a new comment for each plan by default, so the Infracost comment will appear next to that.
- `hide-and-new`: Minimize previous cost estimate comments and create a new one. Pull request followers will be notified on each comment. This behavior is available only for GitHub and offers the same functionality as the Atlantis `--hide-prev-plan-comments` flag.
- `update`: Create a single comment and update it on changes. This is the "quietest" option. For GitLab/Azure DevOps Repos users, comments will simply be overwritten. GitHub users have additional UI that shows [what/when changed](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations/tracking-changes-in-a-comment) when the comment is updated. Pull request followers will only be notified on the comment create (not updates), and the comment will stay at the same location in the comment history.
- `delete-and-new`: Delete previous cost estimate comments and create a new one. Pull request followers will be notified on each comment.

## Migration guide

1. Follow the [infracost-atlantis README](https://github.com/infracost/infracost-atlantis) to see how to integrate Infracost with your existing Atlantis workflow.
2. Find [an example](https://github.com/infracost/infracost-atlantis/#examples) that is the closest to your use-case and adapt the example as required. We have developed examples for:

   - [Combined Infracost comment](https://github.com/infracost/infracost-atlantis/tree/master/examples/combined-infracost-comment/README.md): Combine cost estimates from multiple Terraform directories/workspaces into 1 Infracost pull request comment. Only possible with Atlantis 0.18.2 or newer since it uses Atlantis' post_workflow_hooks feature.
   - [Multiple Infracost comments](https://github.com/infracost/infracost-atlantis/tree/master/examples/multiple-infracost-comments/README.md): Post one Infracost pull request comment per Terraform directory/workspace.
   - [Append to Atlantis comment](https://github.com/infracost/infracost-atlantis/tree/master/examples/append-to-atlantis-comments/README.md): Append cost estimates to Atlantis pull request comment output
   - [Slack](https://github.com/infracost/infracost-atlantis/tree/master/examples/slack/README.md): post cost estimates to Slack

   And cost policy examples:

   - Checkout [this example](https://github.com/infracost/infracost-atlantis/tree/master/examples/conftest/README.md) to see how Atlantis' native Conftest integration can be used to check Infracost cost estimates against policies.
   - If you do not use Conftest/Open Policy Agent, you can still set [thresholds](https://github.com/infracost/infracost-atlantis/tree/master/examples/thresholds/README.md) using bash and [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) so notifications or pull request comments are only sent when cost thresholds are exceeded.

If you encounter any issues while migrating, please [create an issue](https://github.com/infracost/infracost-atlantis/issues/new) or join our [community Slack](https://www.infracost.io/community-chat) and we'll address them as soon as possible.

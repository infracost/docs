:::tip
This is the migration guide for the upcoming v0.10 - which has not been released yet.
A [beta](https://github.com/infracost/infracost/releases/tag/v0.10.0-beta.1) is available if you'd like to try an early version.
:::

Once you've [installed Infracost v0.10](/docs/#1-install-infracost), follow this page to migrate. If you run into any issues, please join our [community Slack channel](https://www.infracost.io/community-chat) or [create an issue](https://github.com/infracost/infracost/issues/new), we'll help you very quickly ðŸ˜„

## What's new?

Back in February 2022, we started an experiment to estimate costs by parsing Terraform HCL code directly. We're excited to announce that the experiment worked! So in v0.10 we've removed the experimental `--terraform-parse-hcl` flag and made HCL parsing the default behavior.

Going forward, we'll support two ways to run Infracost with Terraform via `--path`:
1. **Parsing HCL code (directory)**: this is the default and recommended option as it has the following 4 key benefits.
    ```shell
    # Terraform variables can be set using --terraform-var-file or --terraform-var
    infracost breakdown --path /code
    ```
2. **Parsing plan JSON file**: this will continue to work as before.
    ```shell
    cd /code
    terraform init
    terraform plan -out tfplan.binary
    terraform show -json tfplan.binary > plan.json

    infracost breakdown --path plan.json
    ```

### 1. Faster CLI

Infracost can now generate cost estimates *without* needing a Terraform plan. This removes our dependency on the Terraform binary altogether, which means no more `terraform init` or `terraform plan`.

That, in turn, means a super-fast CLI: Infracost used to take around 50 seconds to run on our internal Terraform mono-repo, that's now reduced to 2 seconds. ðŸš€

### 2. No cloud creds needed

Running `terraform plan` requires users to have cloud credentials and Terraform secrets. The main reason we created the Infracost CLI first, instead of a web API, was so it could parse the Terraform plan JSON locally to extract cost-related parameters (e.g. instance type). Thus credentials and secrets were *not* sent anywhere.

Whilst this worked and was safe, it still posed a question: *is there a way to avoid setting credentials or secrets altogether?* Removing our dependency on `terraform plan` gave us a way to do that.

### 3. Cost estimates everywhere

Not needing cloud credentials, or even knowledge of how to generate a Terraform plan, means that *any engineer* who has access to code repos can generate cost estimates!

This also opens the door for cost estimates to be put everywhere: Infra-as-Code repo readmes, Terraform module readmes, Visual Studio, and even in continuous integration systems where a Terraform plan does not exist (not everyone runs Terraform via continuous deployment systems).

To make `infracost diff` work without a Terraform plan, we introduced a new `--compare-to infracost-base.json` flag. This enables a git-based cost diff to be produced, e.g.:
```shell
git checkout main
infracost breakdown --path /code --format json --out-file infracost-base.json

git checkout my-branch
infracost diff --path /code --compare-to infracost-base.json
```

### 4. Detect multi-project repos

Setting the `--path` flag to a top-level repo directory will now attempt to process all projects automatically by:
1. Looking at the specified path or in any of the subdirectories with a depth less than 5.
2. Processing Terraform variable files with the `.auto.tfvars` extension (similar to what Terraform does).
3. Processing environment variables with a `TF_VAR_` prefix (similar to what Terraform does).

If this does not work for your use-case, use a [config-file](/docs/features/config_file/) and run `infracost breakdown --config-file=infracost.yml`, for example:
```yaml
# infracost.yml
version: 0.1
projects:
  - path: prod
    terraform_var_files:
      - prod.tfvars
      - us-east.tfvars

  - path: dev
    terraform_var_files:
      - dev.tfvars
```

#### Option 1: Terraform directory (recommended)

Parsing HCL has no concept of Terraform state. This makes it super-fast, but this means you'll need to compare Infracost runs to show cost differences.

For example, the following v0.9 commands:

```shell
cd /code

# Checkout your feature branch
git checkout my-branch

# Generate Infracost JSON file, this internally invoked the
# Terraform CLI to create a plan JSON that was used by Infracost.
infracost breakdown --path . \
    --format json --out-file infracost.json

infracost comment github --path infracost.json ...
```

Needs to be rewritten as such in v0.10:

```shell
cd /code

# Generate Infracost JSON file as the baseline.
# Terraform variables can be set using --terraform-var-file or --terraform-var
git checkout main

infracost breakdown --path . \
    --format json --out-file infracost-base.json

# Generate a diff by comparing the latest code change with the baseline
git checkout my-branch

infracost diff --path . \
    --compare-to infracost-base.json \
    --format json --out-file infracost.json

infracost comment github --path infracost.json ...
```

#### Option 2: Terraform plan JSON

If you already use Infracost with a Terraform plan JSON, you don't need to change anything as that will continue to work (since the Infracost `--path` flag detects a Terraform plan JSON).

If you were used to running Infracost against a Terraform project directory, and want the old behavior where Infracost invoked the Terraform CLI, you can manually generate a plan JSON and use that instead:
```shell
cd /code
terraform init
terraform plan -out tfplan.binary
terraform show -json tfplan.binary > plan.json

infracost breakdown --path plan.json \
    --format json --out-file infracost.json

infracost comment github --path infracost.json ...
```

:::tip
This is the migration guide for the upcoming v0.10 - which has not been released yet.
A [beta](https://github.com/infracost/infracost/releases/tag/v0.10.0-beta.1) is available if you'd like to try an early version.
:::

Follow this page to migrate your [Infracost GitHub actions](https://github.com/infracost/actions) from v1 to v2. If you encounter any issues while migrating, please join our [community Slack channel](https://www.infracost.io/community-chat), we'll help you very quickly ðŸ˜„

## What's new?

The v1 actions used Infracost v0.9.x of the Infracost CLI, whereas the v2 actions use Infracost v0.10.x. With this new release, we'll support two ways to run Infracost with Terraform via `--path`:
1. **Parsing HCL code (recommended)**: this is the default and recommend option as it has [4 key benefits](/docs/guides/v0.10_migration/#1-faster-cli). This page describes how you can migrate to this option.
<!-- TODO: update the example link -->
2. **Parsing plan JSON file**: this will continue to work as before. There are [examples here](https://github.com/infracost/actions/tree/make-consistent-with-gitlab/examples#plan-json-examples) of generating Terraform plan JSON files in GitHub Actions and passing them to Infracost.

## Actions v2 migration guide

Changing your workflow to work with the parse HCL option requires the following changes:

1. Bump the version of the `infracost/actions/setup` action to `v2`:

   ```yaml
         - name: Setup Infracost
           uses: infracost/actions/setup@v2
           with:
             api-key: ${{ secrets.INFRACOST_API_KEY }}
   ```

2. Remove the Terraform and Terragrunt dependencies. You can remove any `hashicorp/setup-terraform` or `autero1/action-terragrunt` actions as Infracost now parses the HCL code directly, so it does not depend on these.

3. After the "Setup Infracost" step, add a step for generating a cost estimate baseline from the base branch of the pull request (e.g. main/master). This is needed so Infracost has the current state to compare against.

   ```yaml
   - name: Checkout base branch
     uses: actions/checkout@v2
     with:
       ref: '${{ github.event.pull_request.base.ref }}'

   - name: Generate Infracost cost estimate baseline
     run: |
       infracost breakdown --path=/code \
                           --format=json \
                           --out-file=/tmp/infracost-base.json
   ```

   :::note
   You should replace any `--terraform-plan-flags` flags with either `--terraform-var` to add variables or `--terraform-var-file` to point to var files. These work similarly to Terraform's `-var` and `-var-file` flags and can be repeated.
   :::

   :::note
   If you have variables stored on Terraform Cloud/Enterprise Infracost will pull these in automatically if you add the following environment variables to your job:

   ```yaml
   jobs:
     infracost:
       # ...
       env:
         INFRACOST_TERRAFORM_CLOUD_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.TFC_TOKEN }}
         INFRACOST_TERRAFORM_CLOUD_HOST: app.terraform.io # Change this if you're using Terraform Enterprise
   ```
   :::

   <!-- TODO: update the example link -->
   :::note
   If you have a Terraform mono-repo and you want to pass separate variables to each Terraform project you can create a [config file](/docs/features/config_file) and pass that with the `--config-file` flag as per [this example](https://github.com/infracost/actions/tree/make-consistent-with-gitlab/examples/multi-project-config-file#readme)
   :::

4. Add steps for comparing against the Infracost cost estimate baseline. First make sure you check out the pull request branch, and also add any required variable or config file flags as per step 3 to the `infracost diff` command as well.

   ```yml
   - name: Checkout PR branch
     uses: actions/checkout@v2

   - name: Run Infracost
     run: |
       infracost diff --path=/code \
                      --format=json \
                      --compare-to=/tmp/infracost-base.json `# point this to the JSON output we generated in step 2`
                      --out-file=/tmp/infracost.json

    # Post pull request comment in the same was as before by running:
    # infracost comment github --path=/tmp/infracost.json ...
   ```

## Examples

<!-- TODO: update the example link -->
We've updated [our examples](https://github.com/infracost/actions/tree/make-consistent-with-gitlab/examples) to use the new parsing HCL option and added examples for generating a Terraform plan JSON file if required. You can find one that is the closest to your use-case and adapt as required.

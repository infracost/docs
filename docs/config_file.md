We recommend that you create an `infracost.yml` file in each of your Terraform project repos using [this example](https://github.com/infracost/infracost/blob/master/infracost-example.yml). This file can be passed to Infracost using the `--config-file` option and enables you to run Infracost without having to remember various flags.

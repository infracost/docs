### 1. Introduction

Welcome to **Infracost Inc.**

Infracost Inc. (“us”, “we”, or “our”) operates <https://infracost.io> and Infracost command line tools (hereinafter referred to as “Service”).

This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, protect, and share information when you use <https://infracost.io> and our command line tools. It applies whenever you use our Service.

Infracost does not sell Personal Data and does not share Personal Data for cross-context behavioral advertising under the California Privacy Rights Act or any other US state privacy law. If you see a “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” link, it will route to this same statement confirming that we do not sell or share Personal Data for these purposes.

We use your data only to provide and improve Service. By using Service, you agree to the collection and use of your information as described in this Policy. Unless defined here, terms in this Privacy Policy have the meanings given in our Terms and Conditions.

Our Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) govern all use of our Service and together with the Privacy Policy constitute your agreement with us (“agreement”).

Data Controller Information

When Infracost is the Controller: For the purposes of applicable data protection laws (including the GDPR and UK GDPR), Infracost Inc. is the Data Controller for Personal Data that we collect directly from you, such as when you browse our website, register for a personal account, or communicate with our sales and support teams.

When Infracost is the Processor: For all Personal Data (Customer Personal Data) processed within Infracost Cloud, CI/CD pipelines, and source control integrations on behalf of a corporate customer (for example, your employer), Infracost Inc. acts as the Data Processor. We process this data solely in accordance with our Data Processing Agreement and the Customer’s instructions. If you are an end user of a Corporate Customer, your employer is the Data Controller for this processing.

### 2. Definitions

SERVICE means the <https://infracost.io> website and Infracost command line tools operated by Infracost Inc.

PERSONAL DATA means data about a living individual who can be identified from those data (or from those and other information either in our possession or likely to come into our possession).

USAGE DATA is data collected automatically, either generated by the use of Service or from Service infrastructure itself (for example, the duration of a page visit).

COOKIES are small files stored on your device (computer or mobile device).

DATA CONTROLLER means a natural or legal person who (either alone or jointly or in common with other persons) determines the purposes for which and the manner in which any personal data are, or are to be, processed. For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, we are a Data Controller of Personal Data for website visitors, self-registered users, and our own HR and vendor records.

For Customer Personal Data processed within Infracost Cloud when corporate customers use the platform, we act as a Data Processor on behalf of the Customer. The Customer’s privacy notice governs those users, and data subject requests relating to Customer Personal Data may be routed to the Customer. For most Customer Personal Data in Infracost Cloud and CI/CD integrations, the Customer organisation is the Data Controller and Infracost processes that data on their instructions.

DATA PROCESSORS (OR SERVICE PROVIDERS) means any natural or legal person who processes the data on behalf of the Data Controller. We may use the services of various Service Providers in order to process your data more effectively.

DATA SUBJECT is any living individual who is the subject of Personal Data.

THE USER is the individual using our Service. The User corresponds to the Data Subject, who is the subject of Personal Data.

### 3. Information Collection and Use

We collect several different types of information for various purposes to provide and improve our Service to you.

We collect Personal Data directly from you when you use Service, create an account, or communicate with us. We also collect certain data automatically through the operation of Service, including telemetry and diagnostic data generated by our tools. For users who access Infracost Cloud through their employer or another organization, that organization may provide certain account or configuration details to us to enable and manage your access to Service.

For business-to-business contacts, we may also receive professional contact details from our customer relationship management and enrichment providers or from publicly available sources (for example, company websites or professional profiles), and we use this information for sales and marketing communications as described in this Privacy Policy.

When Infracost Cloud processes Customer Personal Data that relates to code, infrastructure definitions, cost data, CI/CD activity, or similar content, this data is handled on behalf of the Customer and in accordance with their instructions. These processing activities typically occur in isolated, ephemeral environments that are created and deleted during the platform's normal operation.

### 4. Types of Data Collected

You may change or withdraw your cookie choices at any time by reopening the cookie banner via the “Cookie Settings” link on our website.

This data is not collected through Service and is mentioned here only to clarify that it is processed separately for employment and recruitment purposes. These activities are carried out in accordance with applicable legal obligations and our internal HR privacy notices.

### 5. Use of Data

Except where we act as a processor on behalf of a Customer for Customer Personal Data in Infracost Cloud and CI/CD integrations as described in Section 3, this Section 5 explains how we use Personal Data when we act as a controller.

Infracost Inc. uses the collected data for various purposes:

(a) to provide and maintain our Service;

(b) to notify you about changes to our Service;

(c) to allow you to participate in interactive features of our Service when you choose to do so;

(d) to provide customer support;

(e) to gather analysis or valuable information so that we can improve our Service;

(f) to monitor the usage of our Service;

(g) to detect, prevent, and address technical issues;

(h) to fulfill any other purpose for which you provide it;

(i) to carry out our obligations and enforce our rights arising from any contracts entered into between you and us, including for billing and collection;

(j) to provide you with notices about your account and/or subscription, including expiration and renewal notices, email instructions, etc.;

(k) to provide you with news, special offers, and general information about other goods, services, and events which we offer that are similar to those that you have already purchased or enquired about, unless you have opted not to receive such information;

(l) in any other way we may describe when you provide the information;

(m) for any other purpose with your consent.

For Customer Personal Data processed inside Infracost Cloud, we act as a processor and process that data only for the purposes determined by the Customer and documented in our Data Processing Agreement. This includes all code, infrastructure as code, cloud configuration and cost-related Customer Personal Data processed via Infracost Cloud, CI/CD integrations and isolated runners or containers.

Under the GDPR and UK GDPR, the legal bases for our processing activities may include the performance of a contract, compliance with legal obligations, and your consent where required. The specific legal basis depends on the circumstances and type of data processed.

Lawful Basis for Cookie-Related Processing

We use Functional, Analytics, Performance, and Advertising cookies only after you provide consent through our cookie banner. These cookies are not essential to the operation of Service and remain disabled unless you enable them.

Necessary cookies are processed in accordance with our legitimate interest in maintaining the security, stability, and essential functionality of Service.

Legal Bases for Processing Personal Data

We process Personal Data for the purposes in this policy on the following lawful bases: fulfilling contracts (including providing Service and managing user accounts), meeting legal obligations (for example to maintain appropriate security, prevent misuse, and comply with accounting and tax requirements), and obtaining consent where this is required for specific activities such as direct marketing or the use of non-essential cookies or similar technologies.

### 6. Retention of Data

We will retain your Personal Data only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We will retain and use your Personal Data to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.

We also retain Usage Data for internal analysis purposes. Usage Data is generally kept for a shorter period, except when used to improve the security or functionality of our Service, or when we are legally required to retain it for a longer period.

Customer Personal Data processed inside Infracost Cloud is retained for the duration of the Customer’s subscription or contract and is removed from active systems after the Customer terminates service, unless a longer retention period is required by law.

Different categories of data may have different retention periods, including, but not limited to, log data, CRM and account information, customer support records, and human resources or recruitment data, which are subject to separate retention requirements and notices.

To provide additional transparency as required by applicable data protection laws, certain categories of data have defined retention periods. For example, log data is typically retained for approximately 365 days, application error events for approximately 90 days, and Customer account data is permanently deleted approximately 60 days after service termination. Backups follow AWS-managed retention schedules and are retained solely for business continuity and disaster recovery purposes; they are not used for active processing. These periods reflect our operational, security, and legal requirements.

### 7. Transfer of Data

Your information, including Personal Data, may be transferred to and maintained on computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ from those of your jurisdiction.

If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, please note that we transfer the data, including Personal Data, to the United States for processing.

Infracost Inc. will take all reasonable steps to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy, and no transfer of your Personal Data will take place to an organization or a country unless adequate controls are in place, including controls over the security of your data and other personal information.

When we transfer Personal Data from the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, or other regions with data transfer requirements to the United States or other countries, we rely on appropriate safeguards. These include the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (where applicable), the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses, and the UK International Data Transfer Addendum. Where we rely on Standard Contractual Clauses, we also implement supplementary measures, such as encryption in transit and at rest, strict access controls, and security practices, to ensure an equivalent level of protection for Personal Data.

For Customer Personal Data processed inside Infracost Cloud, international transfers are carried out in accordance with our Data Processing Agreement and the Customer’s instructions.

### 8. Disclosure of Data

We may disclose personal information that we collect, or you provide:

(a) Disclosure for Law Enforcement.

Under certain circumstances, we may be required to disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities.

(b) Business Transaction.

If we or our subsidiaries are involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your Personal Data may be transferred.

(i) to our subsidiaries and affiliates;

(v) for any other purpose disclosed by us when you provide the information;

(vi) with your consent in any other cases;

(vii) if we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property, or safety of the Company, our customers, or others.

### 9. Security of Data

We use appropriate administrative, technical, and organizational safeguards to protect Personal Data. Our measures include: encryption of data in transit and at rest; role-based and least-privileged access controls; strong authentication requirements; logging and monitoring of system activity; backup and recovery processes; vulnerability management; and assessments of third-party suppliers processing Personal Data for us.

The security of your data is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% percent secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

### 10. Your Data Protection Rights Under General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

If you are a resident of the European Union (EU), the European Economic Area (EEA), or the United Kingdom (UK), you have certain data protection rights under the GDPR. – See more at <https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj>

We aim to take reasonable steps to allow you to correct, amend, delete, or limit the use of your Personal Data.

If you wish to be informed of the Personal Data we hold about you and have it removed from our systems, please email us at <support@infracost.io>.

In certain circumstances, you have the following data protection rights:

(a) the right to access, update, or delete the information we have on you;

(b) the right of rectification. You have the right to have your information rectified if that information is inaccurate or incomplete;

(c) the right to object. You have the right to object to our processing of your Personal Data;

Withdrawal of Cookie Consent

You may withdraw your cookie consent at any time by reopening the cookie banner and updating your selections. Withdrawal does not affect the lawfulness of processing carried out before the withdrawal was made.

Please note that we may ask you to verify your identity before responding to such requests. Please note, we may not be able to provide Service without some necessary data.

You have the right to complain to a Data Protection Authority about our collection and use of your Personal Data. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority in the European Economic Area (EEA), the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), or the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC).

We respond to requests within one month, as required under GDPR, and may extend this period by an additional 2 months if the request is complex or we receive multiple requests. We may refuse to act on a request or charge a reasonable fee where a request is manifestly unfounded or excessive. Where we act as a processor of Customer Personal Data in Infracost Cloud, we may forward your request to the Customer, where required, as they control the processing of that data.

### 11. Your Data Protection Rights under the California Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA)

CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and, conceivably, the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. – See more at: <https://consumercal.org/about-cfc/cfc-education-foundation/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa-3/>

(a) users can visit our site anonymously;

(b) our Privacy Policy link includes the word “Privacy”, and can easily be found on the page specified above on the home page of our website;

(c) users will be notified of any privacy policy changes on our Privacy Policy Page;

(d) users are able to change their personal information by emailing us at <support@infracost.io>.

Our Policy on “Do Not Track” Signals:

We honor Do Not Track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track browser mechanism is in place. Do Not Track is a preference you can set in your web browser to inform websites that you do not want to be tracked.

You can enable or disable Do Not Track by visiting the Preferences or Settings page of your web browser.

### 11A. Your Data Protection Rights Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) as Amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA)

California residents have certain rights regarding their Personal Data. These rights apply to the Personal Data that we collect, use, or disclose in the course of providing our Service.

These rights include:

(a) the right to know the categories of Personal Data we collect, the purposes for which it is used, and the categories of third parties to whom it is disclosed;

The Infracost CLI uses a number of environment variables to customize various aspects of its behavior; these can be particularly useful in [CI/CD integrations](/docs/integrations/cicd). Configuration values are chosen in this order:
1. CLI flags (run `infracost --help` to see them)
2. Environment variables
3. [Config file](/docs/features/config_file)
4. Infracost Cloud organization settings

### INFRACOST_API_KEY
Infracost API key, run `infracost auth login` to sign up or log in via the CLI. Run `infracost configure get api_key` to retrieve your API key. Use [Infracost Cloud](/docs/infracost_cloud/authentication/) to rotate your API key.

We recommend using this environment variable in CI/CD integrations; it overrides any values you might have set in `.config/infracost/credentials.yml`, `.env` or `.env.local` too.

### INFRACOST_CURRENCY
The currency ([ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217#Active_codes)) prices should be converted to. Defaults to USD.
This is only used by the `infracost breakdown` and `diff` commands. The `output` command uses the currency from the Infracost JSON file.

### INFRACOST_ENABLE_CLOUD
Can be set to `true` to enable [Infracost Cloud](/docs/infracost_cloud/overview/). The main use-case for this is in CI/CD and it should only be set for the `infracost diff` command so only the Infracost JSON output from that step is sent to your Infracost Cloud account.

### INFRACOST_LOG_LEVEL
Controls the log verbosity level. Can be set to `info` or `warn` in CI/CD systems to reduce noise, or `debug` to troubleshoot. Turns off spinners in output. Setting this environment variable is the same as using the `--log-level` flag.

### INFRACOST_SKIP_UPDATE_CHECK
Set to `true` to skip the Infracost update check; can be useful in CI/CD systems. We regularly add support for new resources so we recommend watching our repo for releases: goto the [repo](https://github.com/infracost/infracost) page, click on the Watch button > select Custom > Releases and click on Apply. Be sure to upgrade regularly.

### INFRACOST_TERRAFORM_WORKSPACE
Used to set the Terraform workspace (this sets the [`TF_WORKSPACE`](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cli/config/environment-variables.html#tf_workspace) internally). The `--terraform-workspace` flag can also be used.
  ```shell
  INFRACOST_TERRAFORM_WORKSPACE=dev infracost breakdown --path /code
  ```

Only set this for multi-workspace deployments, otherwise it might result in the Terraform error "workspaces not supported". If you see this error, try running `unset INFRACOST_TERRAFORM_WORKSPACE` and `unset TF_WORKSPACE`.

### INFRACOST_TERRAFORM_CLOUD_TOKEN
For Terraform Cloud/Enterprise users, set this to a [Team API Token or User API Token](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/users-teams-organizations/api-tokens.html) so Infracost can use it to access the plan.

### INFRACOST_TERRAFORM_CLOUD_HOST
For Terraform Enterprise users, used to override the default `app.terraform.io` backend host.

### INFRACOST_PARALLELISM
If using multiple projects using a [config_file](/docs/features/config_file) this limits the number of projects processed in parallel. By default the parallelization level is set to 4Ã—CPU count but capped at 16. To help with debugging set this to `1` so that the projects are processed synchronously.

### Terraform environment variables
Standard Terraform [environment variables](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/environment-variables.html) such as `TF_CLI_CONFIG_FILE`, `TF_WORKSPACE` and `TF_VAR_` can also be added if required, for example:
```shell
TF_CLI_CONFIG_FILE="$HOME/.terraformrc-custom" infracost breakdown \
    --path /path/to/code
```

## Environment variables to override metadata

The following environment variables can be used with `infracost breakdown` and `diff` to override the values that are automatically generated as part of the [Infracost JSON output](/docs/features/cli_commands/#examples). This is useful when [uploading an Infracost JSON file](/docs/features/cli_commands/#upload-runs) to Infracost Cloud.

:::note
We recommend exporting environment variables using quotes so values with spaces are captured correctly, e.g. `export MY_ENV="my value"`

### When a pull request exists
If you are integrating Infracost into a CI/CD system and you have pull requests, you can use the following environment variables to override relevant metadata.

**Required:**
- `INFRACOST_VCS_PROVIDER`: can be "github", "gitlab", "azure_repos" or "bitbucket"
- `INFRACOST_VCS_REPOSITORY_URL`: HTTPS URL of the repository, e.g. "https://github.com/infracost/example-terraform"
- `INFRACOST_VCS_PULL_REQUEST_URL`: HTTP URL of the pull request, e.g. "https://github.com/alikhajeh1/example-terraform/pull/2"
- `INFRACOST_VCS_PULL_REQUEST_AUTHOR`: author username or full name of the pull request, e.g. "john190" or "John Smith"
- `INFRACOST_VCS_PULL_REQUEST_TITLE`: title of the pull request, e.g. "Increase IOPS"

The following example shows how you can override the above environment variables in the [Infracost Atlantis integration](https://github.com/infracost/infracost-atlantis):

  ```bash
  INFRACOST_VCS_PROVIDER="github" # For GitHub Enterprise, also use "github"
  INFRACOST_VCS_REPOSITORY_URL="https://github.com/$BASE_REPO_OWNER/$BASE_REPO_NAME"
  INFRACOST_VCS_PULL_REQUEST_URL="$INFRACOST_VCS_REPOSITORY_URL/pulls/$PULL_NUM"
  INFRACOST_VCS_PULL_REQUEST_AUTHOR="$PULL_AUTHOR"

  INFRACOST_VCS_PULL_REQUEST_TITLE=\"$(curl -s \
      -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
      -H "Authorization: $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
      "https://api.github.com/repos/$BASE_REPO_OWNER/$BASE_REPO_NAME/pulls/$PULL_NUM" | jq -r '.title')\"
  ```

**Optional:**
- `INFRACOST_VCS_BASE_BRANCH`: name of the base branch that the pull request is being merged into, this is usually "master" or "main"
- `INFRACOST_VCS_BRANCH`: name of the branch that was used to generate the estimate, e.g. "increase_iops"
- `INFRACOST_VCS_COMMIT_SHA`: long commit SHA of the branch that was used to generate the estimate, e.g. "1af413ad15ad6cbdfca667361231231231231231"
- `INFRACOST_VCS_COMMIT_MESSAGE`: the commit message, e.g. "use m5.large"
- `INFRACOST_VCS_COMMIT_TIMESTAMP`: unix epoch timestamp of the commit, e.g. `1661801540`. You can use the following command to get the timestamp on the latest commit from the current branch `export INFRACOST_VCS_COMMIT_TIMESTAMP=$(git show -s --format=%ct)`
- `INFRACOST_VCS_COMMIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL`: git email of author of the commit, e.g. "john@company.com"
- `INFRACOST_VCS_COMMIT_AUTHOR_NAME`: git author name of the commit, e.g. "John Smith"
- `INFRACOST_VCS_SUB_PATH`: path of the project relative to the root of the code repository, e.g. "prod/us-east"
- `INFRACOST_TERRAFORM_WORKSPACE`: Terraform workspace if specified for the project, e.g. "prod"
- `INFRACOST_VCS_PIPELINE_RUN_ID`: a way to differentiate pipelines that are run within one pull request, this is the top-level pipeline ID, not individual jobs/runs within it, e.g. "2846680866"

### When no pull requests exist

If you are integrating Infracost into a CI/CD system and you do not use pull requests in your workflow, you can use the following environment variables to override relevant metadata.

**Required:**
- `INFRACOST_VCS_PROVIDER`: can be "github", "gitlab", "azure_repos" or "bitbucket"
- `INFRACOST_VCS_REPOSITORY_URL`: HTTPS URL of the repository, e.g. "https://github.com/infracost/example-terraform"
- `INFRACOST_VCS_BRANCH`: name of the branch that was used to generate the estimate, e.g. "increase_iops"
- `INFRACOST_VCS_COMMIT_SHA`: long commit SHA of the branch that was used to generate the estimate, e.g. "1af413ad15ad6cbdfca667361231231231231231"
- `INFRACOST_VCS_COMMIT_MESSAGE`: the commit message, e.g. "use m5.large"
- `INFRACOST_VCS_COMMIT_TIMESTAMP`: unix epoch timestamp of the commit, e.g. `1661801540`. You can use the following command to get the timestamp on the latest commit from the current branch `export INFRACOST_VCS_COMMIT_TIMESTAMP=$(git show -s --format=%ct)`
- `INFRACOST_VCS_COMMIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL`: git email of author of the commit, e.g. "john@company.com"
- `INFRACOST_VCS_COMMIT_AUTHOR_NAME`: git author name of the commit, e.g. "John Smith"

**Optional:**
- `INFRACOST_VCS_SUB_PATH`: path of the project relative to the root of the code repository, e.g. "prod/us-east"
- `INFRACOST_TERRAFORM_WORKSPACE`: Terraform workspace if specified for the project, e.g. "prod"
- `INFRACOST_VCS_PIPELINE_RUN_ID`: a way to differentiate pipelines that are run within one CI/CD run, this is the top-level pipeline ID, not individual jobs/runs within it, e.g. "2846680866"

All Infracost Cloud users get a weekly email of the most impactful changes across all repos in their organizations. This email shows the most impactful changes across repos, projects, pull requests and users. 

From the Reports page, you can also create custom reports to filter on specific pull requests (e.g. only report on certain repositories or merged pull requests) and select the report frequency (daily, weekly, monthly). You can also select which users should get the reports.

Infracost Cloud is our SaaS product that builds on top of Infracost open source. It gives team leads, managers and FinOps practitioners dashboards, guardrails and centralized cost policies so they can help guide the team (e.g. switch AWS GP2 volumes to GP3). See our [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDi6GE9RIik) to learn more.

Send a new pull request to change something in Terraform that costs money, you should see a pull request comment in your CI/CD system.

If you do not use the `infracost comment` command in your CI/CD system, you can [upload Infracost JSON files](/docs/features/cli_commands/#upload-runs) to Infracost Cloud.

### 5. See cost estimate in Infracost Cloud

Go to [**Infracost Cloud**](https://dashboard.infracost.io) > **your organization** > **Dashboard** to see your pull request on the chart and cost breakdowns by repo, pull request and user. Clicking on a chart dot shows the corresponding estimate so you can investigate deeper or talk to the people working on the change.

# Github Login

Infracost supports logging in via Github SSO.

## Email Verification Troubleshooting

When signing into Infracost via Github, your work email must be listed as a verified email to properly match up with your Infracost account.

If the Github email is not verified, you'll receive an error message when attempting to sign in asking you to [verify your email with Github](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/verifying-your-email-address#verifying-your-email-address).

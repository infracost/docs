Enterprises often have thousands of code repos across many departments, divisions or business units. FinOps teams are usually centralized and need visibility across the enterprise so they can better prioritize their efforts. We released a new enterprise data export feature to provide this visibility. Using this data, FinOps teams can, for example, see that departmentA is doing well when it comes to latest generation instance types being used, but need help improving their tagging coverage; or that departmentB has few data retention policies so specific training might be needed.

Infracost Cloud lets you export FinOps and tagging issues across all of your repos, as well as cost estimates of all your pull requests. This data, available in CSV format, can be imported into your existing cloud cost dashboards and tools such as PowerBI or Tableau.

## Usage

This guide describes how you can set up the Infracost Cloud data export to deliver CSV files to your AWS S3 or Azure Blob Storage.

Data exports can be setup at either the Infracost organization level, or the enterprise level (an enterprise contains multiple organizations).

### Organization data export
Once configured, two CSV files will be updated daily with the latest information, replacing any earlier versions of the file:
1. `infracost_merged_closed_prs_YYYYMM.csv` containing information on pull requests that were merged or closed during the current month and year. This data can be used to see the portion of cloud costs caused by engineering changes, versus organic changes from things like data transfer.
2. `infracost_open_prs.csv` containing information on pull requests that are currently open. This data can be used to see potential increases that'll impact your costs in the future, so you are not surprised and can plan accordingly.

Both files have the same set of CSV fields. You can see the schema by browsing to Infracost Cloud > Visibility > Cost explorer and clicking on the Export CSV button to get an example file from your dataset.

### Enterprise data export
The enterprise data export consists of daily CSV files that contain a summary of all tagging and FinOps policy issues across all code repos in all organizations that are part of your enterprise. This data export also includes the number of issues that were prevented or fixed and the total amount of cost prevention or reduction from your policies.

- `infracost_enterprise_branch_summary_YYYYMMDD.csv`: This file shows the current issues from the base branches (e.g. main or master) of all repos across all Infracost orgs, so you can see trends over time. Each file is a complete snapshot of the time it was generated at. This file will show 0 in the issues columns if a repo has no issues. Repos archived and deleted in GitHub/GitLab are not included in this file so the numbers shown will match the Infracost Cloud dashboard. If a repo is renamed, the next day's exported file will reflect the new `repo_name`. 
- `infracost_enterprise_merged_prs_summary_YYYYMM.csv`: This file shows the cost impact for all pull requests merged in the month. Thus this file has the same data that is used in the cost impact summary in the Infracost Cloud dashboard.

   Every day, the file for the current month will be updated with the latest information for the month-to-date, replacing any earlier versions of the file. So for example, on the first day of April 2024, infracost_merged_prs_summary_202404.csv will be created, and on the 2nd of April, the same file will be overwritten with the latest information. On the 1st of May, infracost_merged_prs_summary_202405.csv will be created.

   Only repos that have merged pull requests appear in this file. If a repo has no impact data for the current month, it will not be included in this file. If a repo is archived or deleted in GitHub/GitLab, it will still be included in this file as long as it has merged pull requests in the current month. If a repo is renamed, the next day's exported file will reflect the new `repo_name`. 
- `infracost_enterprise_licenses_summary_YYYYMM.csv`: This file shows the total number of licenses used across all Infracost orgs in the enterprise for the current month. The pull request authors are de-duplicated across the Infracost orgs in the enterprise. This file will always have 1 row. 

## Export to AWS S3 bucket

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy that allows Infracost to upload the CSV reports to your AWS S3 bucket.

### Prerequisites

1. An active AWS account
2. A pre-existing S3 bucket where the Infracost will upload the CSV reports
3. AWS Management Console access
4. Your Infracost **Org ID**. This can be found in [Infracost Cloud](https://dashboard.infracost.io) > **Org Settings** > **Details** section.

### Step 1: Create IAM Policy

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the [IAM Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/).
2. In the navigation pane, click on **Policies** and then click on **Create policy**.
3. Choose the **JSON** tab and replace the existing content with the following policy:

   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": [
           "s3:PutObject",
           "s3:PutObjectAcl",
           "s3:ListBucket",
           "s3:GetObject"
         ],
         "Resource": [
           "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR-BUCKET_NAME",
           "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR-BUCKET_NAME/*"
         ]
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

4. Replace `YOUR-BUCKET_NAME` in the `Resource` field with the name of your S3 bucket where Infracost will upload the
   CSV report.
5. Click on **Review policy**.
6. On the Review policy page, name your policy **infracost-data-export-s3**, then click on **Create policy**.

### Step 2: Create IAM Role

1. In the IAM console, click on **Roles** in the navigation pane and then click on **Create role**.
2. Select **Another AWS account** as the trusted entity type.
3. Enter the Infracost AWS account ID `237144093413` in the **Account ID** field. This ensures that only Infracost can
   assume the role.
4. Check the **Require external ID** checkbox and enter your Infracost **Org Id**. This can be found
   in [Infracost Cloud](https://dashboard.infracost.io) > **Org Settings** > **Details** section.
5. Click on **Next: Permissions**.
6. In the search box, search for the **infracost-data-export-s3** policy you created in Step 1, select it, and then
   click on **Next: Tags**.
7. Optionally, you can add tags to the role. Click on **Next: Review** after adding tags or skip it.
8. On the Review page, name the role **infracost-data-export**, then click on **Create role**. You will be returned to 
   the list of roles.
9. Search for the **infracost-data-export** role you just created and click on its name.
10. On the role details page, copy the Role ARN (Amazon Resource Name) located at the top of the page. You will need to
    enter this ARN in Infracost Cloud.

### Step 3: Configure Infracost Cloud

1. Log in to [Infracost Cloud](https://dashboard.infracost.io) and navigate to **Reports** > **Data Export**.
2. Click on the **AWS S3 Bucket** section
3. Enter the **AWS S3 Bucket Name** and **Region**.
4. Fill in the **AWS Role ARN** field with the ARN for the Role you created in step 2.
5. Click the **Test Connection** button and make sure it reports success. This will create an empty **infracost-export-test.txt** in your S3 bucket.
6. Use the **Save** button to complete the setup.

Your first report should be created in a few minutes and will continue to be updated approximately daily. You can return to the **Data Export** page to check on the status of your reports.

## Export to Azure Blob Storage

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up data export from Infracost Cloud to Azure Blob Storage using a Service Principal. This allows Infracost to store the CSV files containing cost estimate data for your pull requests in your Azure Blob Storage.

### Prerequisites

1. An active Azure account
2. An existing Azure Storage Account and a Blob Container
3. Access to the Azure Portal
4. [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) installed locally, or access to Cloud Shell
   in the Azure Portal.

### Step 1: Create Service Principal

1. Construct a scope that provides access limited to your Blob Container. This will be attached to the Service Principle and should look like:
   ```
   /subscriptions/<Your-Subscription-ID>/resourceGroups/<Your-Resource-Group-Name>/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/<Your-Resource-Group-Name>/blobServices/default/containers/<Your-Container-Name>/blobServices/default/containers/<Your-Container-Name>
   ```
   An easy way to do this is to navigate to **Storage Accounts** page in Azure Portal and click on the name of your storage account. Then in the storage account **Overview** section, click on the **JSON view** link and copy the **Resource ID** to your clipboard. Complete the scope by appending `/blobServices/default/containers/<Your-Container-Name>` to the end of this string.
   

2. Open your command prompt or terminal and sign in to your Azure account using the Azure CLI by running the command:

   ```
   az login
   ```

   Alternatively, [open a bash Cloud Shell in the Azure Portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/quickstart?tabs=azurecli).
   The Azure CLI is automatically installed and logged in when using this method.


3. Create a Service Principal for Infracost with the following `az` command.

   ```
   az ad sp create-for-rbac \
      --name "Infracost-Export" \
      --role "Storage Blob Data Contributor" \
      --scope "<Scope-String-From-Step-1>"
   ```

4. Take note of the `appId`, `password`, and `tenant` values in the output, as these will be needed to configure Infracost Cloud data export.

### Step 2: Configure Infracost Cloud

1. Log in to [Infracost Cloud](https://dashboard.infracost.io) and navigate to **Reports** > **Data Export**.
2. Click on the **Azure Blob Storage** section.
3. Enter the **Storage Account Name** and **Container Name** indicating where the CSV files should be created.
4. Fill in the **Client ID**, **Client Secret**, and **Tenant ID** using the `appId`, `password`, and `tenant` values generated in step 1.
5. Click the **Test Connection** button and make sure it reports success. This will create an empty **infracost-export-test.txt** in your Blob Storage container.
6. Use the **Save** button to complete the setup.

Your first report should be created in a few minutes and will continue to be updated approximately daily. You can return to the **Data Export** page to check on the status of your reports.

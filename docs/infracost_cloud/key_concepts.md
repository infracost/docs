## Organizations

In Infracost Cloud, organizations are used to manage API keys and associated settings. Every Infracost user has a default organization for personal use. We recommend creating a new organization for your company API key as in the future you'll be able to add other users to organizations.

### API keys

Infracost API keys are associated with organizations and can be retrieved from the Org Settings page. If you revoke an API key and generate a new one in its place, you must update all CI/CD integrations and CLI installations that used the old API key.

### Multi-user support

Coming soon! You'll be able to invite other users to your organization and also change the organization owner.

## Repos

Repos (short for "code repositories") are the typical method of code organization used by infrastructure-as-code teams. A repo contains one or more projects. Infracost Cloud lets you track how the costs of the projects within a repo may change in the future.

## Projects

Projects are a flexible concept in Infracost that are used to represent deployment environments, workspaces, code paths (i.e. modules) etc.

Infracost auto-generates project names based on the repo name, detected workspaces or code paths, or user-provided path. The name appears in the CLI output and pull request comments and Infracost Cloud as shown below.

### Override project names

Sometimes, like when a path such as `/tmp/plan.json` is used, the name can become long and hard to understand. In those cases you may want to set the name to something more understandable.

Use the `--project-name` flag with `infracost breakdown` and `diff` to override the auto-generated project name. This flag can also be set in CI/CD integrations, where you can also use environment variables to customize the value.

```shell
infracost breakdown --path plan.json --project-name my-project-123

infracost diff --path plan.json --project-name my-project-123
```

:::tip
The `--project-name` flag should be set to the same value for both `infracost breakdown` and `diff` commands in CI/CD integrations. Otherwise the diff command will not be able to match the projects from the first breakdown run. Failing to do this results in odd diffs.
:::

The `name` attribute in [config-files](/docs/features/config_file/) provides the same functionality as `--project-name`.

## Does Infracost need my AWS credentials?

Infracost itself does not need any AWS credentials, but Infracost uses your existing `terraform` binary to execute `terraform init` and `terraform plan` to produce [plan JSON files](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/show.html#json-output). This process requires Terraform to have access to your cloud credentials. The Terraform commands used by Infracost do not make any changes to your Terraform state or cloud resources,

## How does Infracost get its prices?
Infracost gets its prices from a [pricing API](https://github.com/infracost/cloud-pricing-api). These prices are continually updated with the latest AWS prices.

We offer a free hosted pricing API. There is also the option of running your own pricing API and configuring your infracost installation to point to it.

## What data is sent to the hosted pricing API?
The pricing API only needs the relevant data to return a unique AWS price point. No cloud credentials, secrets, tags or Terraform resource identifiers are sent to the pricing API.

Here is an example request to the pricing API for a t3.micro instance and the returned response:

Request:
```graphql
query {
  products(
    filter: {
      vendorName: "aws",
      service: "AmazonEC2",
      productFamily: "Compute Instance",
      region: "us-east-1",
      attributeFilters: [
        { key: "instanceType", value: "t3.micro" },
        { key: "tenancy", value: "Shared" },
        { key: "capacitystatus", value: "Used" },
        { key: "operatingSystem", value: "Linux" },
        { key: "preInstalledSw", value: "NA" }
      ]
    },
  ) {
    prices(
      filter: {
        purchaseOption: "on_demand"
      }
    ) { priceHash, USD }
  }
}

```

Response:
```json

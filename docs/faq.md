## What Terraform versions are supported?

Infracost works with Terraform v0.12 and above.

To change the path to the `terraform` binary, set the `TERRAFORM_BINARY` env variable:
```sh
TERRAFORM_BINARY=~/bin/terraform_0.13 infracost --tfdir /path/to/code
```

## Does Infracost need cloud credentials?

Infracost itself does not need any cloud credentials.

Infracost runs Terraform internally and depending on which Infracost [usage method](/docs/#usage-methods) is used, Terraform might need access to cloud credentials, e.g. when running `terraform init` and `terraform plan`. These commands are only used to produce [plan JSON files](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/show.html#json-output) and no changes are made to your Terraform state or cloud resources.

## How does Infracost get cloud prices?

Infracost gets prices from the [Cloud Pricing API](https://github.com/infracost/cloud-pricing-api). We offer a free Cloud Pricing API and continually update it with the latest cloud vendor prices.

## What data is sent to the hosted Cloud Pricing API?

The Cloud Pricing API needs the relevant data to return a unique cloud price point. We also send the count of Terraform resource types to the Cloud Pricing API to enable us to better prioritize support for new resources. Error tracking events are also sent so we can identify and fix issues quickly.

Here is an example request to the Cloud Pricing API for a t3.micro instance and the returned response:

Request:
```graphql
query {
  products(
    filter: {
      vendorName: "aws",
      service: "AmazonEC2",
      productFamily: "Compute Instance",
      region: "us-east-1",
      attributeFilters: [
        { key: "instanceType", value: "t3.micro" },
        { key: "tenancy", value: "Shared" },
        { key: "capacitystatus", value: "Used" },
        { key: "operatingSystem", value: "Linux" },
        { key: "preInstalledSw", value: "NA" }
      ]
    },
  ) {
    prices(
      filter: {
        purchaseOption: "on_demand"
      }
    ) { priceHash, USD }
  }
}

```

Response:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "products": [
      {
        "prices": [
          {
            "priceHash": "2f1bc092c9e34dc084a4d96d19ef47ca-d2c98780d7b6e36641b521f1f8145c6f",
            "USD": "0.0104000000"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Can I run my own Cloud Pricing API?

Yes! The [Cloud Pricing API repo](https://github.com/infracost/cloud-pricing-api) has instructions on how it can be run. You can point the Infracost CLI to your deployment using the `INFRACOST_PRICING_API_ENDPOINT` environment variable, e.g. https://cloud-pricing-api.mydomain.com.

## What's the difference between Infracost and Terraform Cloud's cost estimation?

The key differences are:
1. Infracost is free and open-source, Terraform Cloud's cost estimation is paid and closed source.
2. Infracost [supports more resources](/docs/supported_resources) than Terraform Cloud's cost estimation feature.
3. Infracost has a [CLI tool](/docs#installation) that can be used in your terminal or [integrated](/docs/integrations) into your workflows regardless of what source control and CI/CD system you use.
4. Infracost can be used with [Terragrunt](/docs/terragrunt).
5. Infracost can output [HTML reports](/docs/report) or JSON and used alongside other tools.

## How do you make money?

We're thinking about an enterprise edition that will connect to your cloud accounts, digest custom price books and discounts to provide more context during cost estimation. This could also include management reporting capabilities, e.g. show a consolidated view of all changes across a business unit.

Use one of our many integrations so your engineering team can see cost estimates in pull requests **before making changes**. This provides your team with a safety net as people can understand cloud costs upfront, and discuss them as part of your workflow.

### Other CI/CD systems

Infracost can be used in any CI/CD system using the following steps. Follow our [GitLab CI integration](https://gitlab.com/infracost/infracost-gitlab-ci/) to see examples of how the following steps are used.

1. Use one of the following options to add the Infracost CLI into your CI/CD:

    <Tabs
      defaultValue="docker"
      values={[
        {label: 'Docker images', value: 'docker'},
        {label: 'CLI executable', value: 'cli-executable'},
    ]}>
      <TabItem value="docker">

      We maintain specific [CI Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/infracost/infracost/tags):
      ```text
      infracost/infracost:ci-0.10 - Recommended, use latest 0.10.x version to pick up bug fixes and new resource costs
      infracost/infracost:ci-0.10.x - Lock the version, see versions in https://github.com/infracost/infracost/releases
      infracost/infracost:ci-latest - Use latest Infracost image, might break when new minor/major versions are released
      ```

      </TabItem>
      <TabItem value="cli-executable">

      Use `curl -O -L https://infracost.io/downloads/v0.10/infracost-linux-amd64.tar.gz` to download the latest 0.10.x version to pick up bug fixes and new resource costs. You can also use lock the version using our [releases](https://github.com/infracost/infracost/releases), or use [latest](tps://github.com/infracost/infracost/releases/latest/download/infracost-linux-amd64.tar.gz), which might break when new minor/major versions are released.

      </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

2. If your infra code is in GitHub, GitLab and Azure Repos or Bitbucket, run the [breakdown, diff and comment commands](/docs/features/cli_commands/#comment-on-pull-requests) to generate a cost estimate and post a comment directly.

  Otherwise, run the [breakdown, diff and output commands](/docs/features/cli_commands/#combined-output-formats) to save the comment markdown (e.g. using `--format github-comment`) and post it from your CI/CD system using curl or other command line tools.

  You should also set the [required environment variables](/docs/features/environment_variables).

If you run into any issues, please join our [community Slack channel](https://www.infracost.io/community-chat), we'll help you very quickly ðŸ˜„

### Third-party integrations

Infracost can also be used alongside many other [third-party systems](/docs/integrations/third_party_integrations/) including Terraform Cloud/Enterprise, Env0, Scalr and Spacelift.

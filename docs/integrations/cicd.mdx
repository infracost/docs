Use one of our many integrations so your engineering team can see cost estimates in pull requests **before making changes**. This provides your team with a safety net as people can discuss costs as part of the workflow.

If you run into any issues, please join our [community Slack channel](https://www.infracost.io/community-chat), we'll help you very quickly ðŸ˜„

## Source control integrations (quick setup)

Infracost supports direct integration with GitHub and GitLab.
<Grid logos={[
    {
      image: "/img/services/github.svg",
      text: "GitHub.com, Enterprise Cloud & Enterprise Server",
      link: "/docs/integrations/github_app",
      newWindow: false
    },
    {
      image: "/img/services/gitlab.svg",
      text: "GitLab.com & self-managed",
      link: "/docs/integrations/gitlab_app",
      newWindow: true
    },
]}/>

<br/>There are two key benefits of using these integrations over CI/CD integrations:

1. You can quickly add Infracost to multiple repos with one click, no need to install or update CLI versions in your CI/CD pipeline. Infracost runs on our infrastructure and we keep it up to date.
2. Infracost runs significantly faster as only changed folders are run based on the GitHub/GitLab App events.

Furthermore, if you use Infracost Cloud (our SaaS product):
- The pull request status (e.g. open, closed, merged) and metadata such as labels, merged-by, and approved-by are included in the dashboard and reports. You can also filter on the pull request status. 
- [Guardrails](/docs/infracost_cloud/guardrails/) and [centralized cost policies](/docs/infracost_cloud/cost_policies/) work without you needing to make changes in your CI/CD pipelines.

## CI/CD integration

The following integrations can also be used to post pull request comments.

<Grid logos={[
    {
      image: "/img/services/github-actions.png",
      link: "https://github.com/infracost/actions",
      newWindow: true
    },
    {
      image: "/img/services/gitlab-ci.png",
      link: "https://gitlab.com/infracost/infracost-gitlab-ci",
      newWindow: true
    },
    {
      image: "/img/services/atlantis.png",
      link: "https://github.com/infracost/infracost-atlantis/",
      newWindow: true
    },
    {
      image: "/img/services/azure-pipelines.png",
      link: "https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Infracost.infracost-tasks",
      newWindow: true
    },
    {
      image: "/img/services/jenkins.svg",
      link: "https://github.com/infracost/infracost-jenkins/",
      newWindow: true
    },
    {
      image: "/img/services/bitbucket-pipelines.png",
      link: "https://bitbucket.org/infracost/infracost-bitbucket-pipeline/src/master/",
      newWindow: true
    },
    {
      image: "/img/services/circleci.svg",
      link: "https://github.com/infracost/infracost-circleci",
      newWindow: true
    },
    {
      link: "/docs/integrations/generic_cicd",
      text: "Other CI/CD integrations using Docker or CLI",
      newWindow: false
    },    
]}/>

## Third-party integrations

Infracost can also be used alongside many other [third-party systems](/docs/integrations/third_party_integrations/) including Terraform Cloud/Enterprise, Env0, Scalr and Spacelift. Note that these integrations are minimal, do not post pull request comments or work fully with other Infracost Cloud features.

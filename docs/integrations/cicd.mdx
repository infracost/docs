Use one of our many integrations so your engineering team can see cost estimates and FinOps best practices in pull requests **before making changes**. This provides your team with a safety net as people can discuss FinOps as part of the workflow.

## Source control integrations (recommended)

Infracost supports direct integration with GitHub and GitLab. We recommend these integrations as they are much simpler to setup and faster to run.

<Grid logos={[
    {
      image: "/docs/img/services/github.svg",
      text: "GitHub.com, Enterprise Cloud & Enterprise Server",
      link: "/docs/integrations/github_app",
      newWindow: false
    },
    {
      image: "/docs/img/services/gitlab.svg",
      text: "GitLab.com & self-managed",
      link: "/docs/integrations/gitlab_app",
      newWindow: true
    },
]}/>

## CI/CD integrations

The following integrations can also be used to post pull request comments.

<Grid logos={[
    {
      image: "/docs/img/services/github-actions.png",
      link: "https://github.com/infracost/actions",
      newWindow: true
    },
    {
      image: "/docs/img/services/gitlab-ci.png",
      link: "https://gitlab.com/infracost/infracost-gitlab-ci",
      newWindow: true
    },
    {
      image: "/docs/img/services/atlantis.png",
      link: "https://github.com/infracost/infracost-atlantis/",
      newWindow: true
    },
    {
      image: "/docs/img/services/azure-pipelines.png",
      link: "https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Infracost.infracost-tasks",
      newWindow: true
    },
    {
      image: "/docs/img/services/jenkins.svg",
      link: "https://github.com/infracost/infracost-jenkins/",
      newWindow: true
    },
    {
      image: "/docs/img/services/bitbucket-pipelines.png",
      link: "https://bitbucket.org/infracost/infracost-bitbucket-pipeline/src/master/",
      newWindow: true
    },
]}/>

For other CI/CD systems, the GitLab CI integration above is a good example to follow. Please [email us](mailto:hello@infracost.io) if you need help. We maintain the [`infracost/infracost:ci-0.10`](https://hub.docker.com/r/infracost/infracost/tags) Docker image that can be used in other CI/CD integrations. This uses the latest patch version of 0.10 to pick up bug fixes and new resources.

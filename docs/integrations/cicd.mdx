Use one of our many integrations so DevOps, SRE and engineers see a cost estimate in pull requests **before making changes**.
This provides your team with a safety net as people can understand cloud costs upfront, and discuss them as part of your workflow.

    const items = logos.map((e, i) => {
      return (<CIBox key={i} {...e}/>)

### My CI/CD system isn't supported

Infracost can be used in any CI/CD system using the following steps. Our [GitLab CI integration](https://gitlab.com/infracost/infracost-gitlab-ci/) follows these steps and has many [examples](https://gitlab.com/infracost/infracost-gitlab-ci/#examples) that you might find useful.

1. Using our CI [Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/infracost/infracost/tags):
    - `infracost/infracost:ci-0.9` - **Recommended**. Use the latest 0.9.x version to pick up bug fixes and new resource costs.
    - `infracost/infracost:ci-0.9.19` - Lock the version.
    - `infracost/infracost:ci-latest` - Use the latest Infracost image. This might break when new minor or major versions are released.

2. [Generate](/docs/troubleshooting/#2-generating-plan-json-files) Terraform plan JSON files from your projects.

3. Run the [breakdown and comment commands](/docs/features/cli_commands/#comment-on-pull-requests) to generate a cost estimate and post a comment to GitHub, GitLab and Azure Repos or Bitbucket. You might also find the [environment variables](/docs/integrations/environment_variables) page useful.

If you run into any issues, please join our [community Slack channel](https://www.infracost.io/community-chat), we'll help you very quickly 😄

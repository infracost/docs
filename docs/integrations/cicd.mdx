Use one of our many integrations so your engineering team can see cost estimates in pull requests **before making changes**. This provides your team with a safety net as people can discuss costs as part of the workflow.

## Source control integrations (recommended)

Infracost supports direct integration with GitHub and GitLab.
We recommend these integrations as they are much simpler to setup, and faster to run. [This page](/docs/guides/source_control_benefits/) explains more about the benefits of source control integrations over CI/CD integrations.

      image: "/docs/img/services/github.svg",

      link: "/docs/integrations/github_app",
      newWindow: false
    },
    {

      text: "GitLab.com & self-managed",
      link: "/docs/integrations/gitlab_app",
      newWindow: true
    },
]}/>

## CI/CD integrations

The following integrations can also be used to post pull request comments.

<Grid logos={[
    {
      image: "/docs/img/services/github-actions.png",
      link: "https://github.com/infracost/actions",
      newWindow: true
    },
    {
      image: "/docs/img/services/gitlab-ci.png",
      link: "https://gitlab.com/infracost/infracost-gitlab-ci",
      newWindow: true
    },
    {
      image: "/docs/img/services/atlantis.png",
      link: "https://github.com/infracost/infracost-atlantis/",
      newWindow: true
    },
    {

      link: "https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Infracost.infracost-tasks",
      newWindow: true
    },
    {
      image: "/docs/img/services/jenkins.svg",
      link: "https://github.com/infracost/infracost-jenkins/",
      newWindow: true
    },
    {

      link: "https://bitbucket.org/infracost/infracost-bitbucket-pipeline/src/master/",
      newWindow: true
    },
    {
      image: "/docs/img/services/circleci.svg",
      link: "https://github.com/infracost/infracost-circleci",
      newWindow: true
    },
    {
      link: "/docs/integrations/generic_cicd",
      text: "Other CI/CD integrations using Docker or CLI",
      newWindow: false
    },
]}/>

## Third-party integrations

Infracost can also be used alongside many other [third-party systems](/docs/integrations/third_party_integrations/) including Terraform Cloud/Enterprise, Env0, Scalr and Spacelift. Note that these integrations are very minimal, do not post pull request comments or work with other Infracost Cloud features such as [Guardrails](/docs/infracost_cloud/guardrails/) or [Tagging policies](/docs/infracost_cloud/tagging_policies/).

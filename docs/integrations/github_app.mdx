The Infracost GitHub App is an automated integration meaning that Infracost runs on our infrastructure and we keep it up to date. Infracost is trusted by thousands of companies around the world, including many of the Fortune 500. We are <a href="https://www.infracost.io/security/" target="_self" rel="">SOC 2 Type II</a> certified.

## Benefits

There are three key benefits of using the GitHub App over manual CI/CD integrations:
1. You can add Infracost to multiple repos with one click, no need to install or update CLI versions in your CI/CD pipeline.
2. Infracost can automatically open pull requests for existing issues so engineers can review and merge them. See [this blog](https://www.infracost.io/blog/ai-for-finops-fix-cloud-cost-issues-faster/) for details.
3. Infracost runs faster as only changed folders are run based on the GitHub App events.

## Usage

1. Go to [Infracost Cloud](https://dashboard.infracost.io) to sign up or log in to start your free trial (no credit card is needed). See [this FAQ](/docs/faq/#can-i-log-in-with-github) if you're having trouble logging in with GitHub.

2. Every Infracost user has a default organization for personal use. Create a new organization for your company using the organization dropdown at the top of the page.

  <img src={useBaseUrl("img/infracost-cloud/create-orgs.png")} alt="Create new organization" />

3. Click on Settings > Org Settings > Integrations > GitHub and follow the wizard to select the repos you want to give Infracost access to.

4. If you use private modules, see [this docs section](/docs/features/terraform_modules/#source-control-integrations).

5. If you need to customize how Infracost runs, add an `infracost.yml` or `infracost.yml.tmpl` [config file](/docs/features/config_file/) in the Repo > my repo > Settings tab, or to the root of your repo. The GitHub App will automatically use that file if it's present. The app will also apply any usage values defined in the `infracost-usage.yml` [usage file](/docs/features/usage_based_resources/) at the root of the repo.

6. Open a test pull request and wait for Infracost to leave a pull request comment. The [Infracost Cloud dashboard](https://dashboard.infracost.io) should also show the cost estimate too.

7. When the pull request is merged the Infracost Cloud dashboard will show you the time it was merged, who approved it, who merged it, and any labels associated with it on GitHub.

8. To fix an existing issue, go to Visibility > Issue Explorer and click on any of the FinOps policy issues. Click on the "Open AutoFix PR" button. Tagging policies aren't supported in AutoFix pull requests.

## GitHub Enterprise

Our automated GitHub App integration works with both GitHub Enterprise Cloud and GitHub Enterprise Server. Directly integrating Infracost Cloud to GitHub Enterprise means you'll get the latest features, the fastest cost estimates and the most robust solution.

### GitHub Enterprise Cloud

Follow the same [usage steps](#usage) as the regular GitHub App above.

#### Incoming traffic to GitHub
If you use the GitHub Enterprise "Enable IP allow list", the Infracost GitHub App will automatically add the required IP address to your GitHub organization's IP allow list. If you need to do that manually, please allow incoming traffic from the following IP addresses to your GitHub instance port 443 (or whatever port you use); these are the IP addresses used by Infracost Cloud services to call the integration:
- 3.133.40.66
- 3.16.104.91
- 3.147.121.170
- 3.141.214.65
- 18.221.82.195
- 18.119.42.142

#### Outgoing traffic from GitHub
If you have restricted out-going traffic from your instance, you need to allow traffic to be sent to `dashboard.api.infracost.io:443` too. If you can only do that by IP address (and not domains), you should allowlist `52.223.24.69`, and `76.223.127.201`.

### GitHub Enterprise Server

Email us at [support@infracost.io](mailto:support@infracost.io) to enable GitHub Enterprise Server in your Infracost Cloud account. This requires a meeting with your server admin so we can install the Infracost GitHub App in your GitHub organization.

Infracost Cloud optionally supports mTLS with GitHub Enterprise Server by using client certificates. If a client's GitHub Enterprise Server requires such a certificate, they have the option to supply Infracost with one. This certificate is securely stored and encrypted at rest. For each request sent to the client's GitHub Enterprise Server, Infracost Cloud will use this certificate. When Infracost Cloud instantiates its ephemeral isolated runners they use this certificate when scanning the code to provide cost estimates and when posting comments to the pull requests.

## How the GitHub App works

The [Infracost GitHub App](https://github.com/marketplace/infracost) is verified by GitHub, and installed in thousands of GitHub orgs. The App needs *write access to pull requests* so it can post a comment with any cost estimates, tagging, and FinOps policy issues. You can select the repos you would like to give access to the App.

<details>
  <summary>Details of required permissions for main Infracost GitHub App</summary>

The main Infracost GitHub App requires the following permissions, which enable all features to be used (including [AutoFix pull requests](https://www.infracost.io/blog/ai-for-finops-fix-cloud-cost-issues-faster/)):

- **Read-only** access is needed for the following so Infracost gets notified of repo or pull request changes and can process the code:
  - Metadata (Search repositories, list collaborators, and access repository metadata)
  - Custom properties (repo and org custom properties values)
  - Merge queues
  - Actions (Workflows, workflow runs and artifacts)
  - Deployments (Deployments and deployment statuses)
  - Package (Packages published to GitHub package platform, e.g. AWS CDK constructs)
  - Issues (Issues and related comments, assignees, labels, and milestones)
  - Administration (Repository creation, deletion, settings, teams, and collaborators)
  - Members (Organization members and teams)
- **Read and write** access is needed for the following so Infracost can post pull request comments, update statuses in GitHub and open AutoFix pull requests:
  - Pull requests (Pull requests and related comments, assignees, labels, milestones, and merges)
  - Contents (Repository contents, commits, branches, downloads, releases, and merges)
  - Checks (checks on code)
  - Commit statuses
  - Webhooks (Manage the post-receive hooks for a repository)

Most companies protect their main/master branches with GitHub [Branch Protection Rules](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches) or [Rulesets](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-rulesets/about-rulesets). This ensures that neither developers nor GitHub Apps can push commits directly to these branches. Therefore, all changes must go through pull requests, where they are reviewed and approved by your engineers. Email support@infracost.io if you have any questions about GitHub App permissions.

<details>
  <summary>Details of required permissions for "Infracost (Limited)" GitHub App</summary>

The "Infracost (Limited)" GitHub App requires the following permissions. Since this App only has Read-only on "Contents", it does not work with the [AutoFix pull requests](/docs/infracost_cloud/autofix/) feature.

- **Read-only** access is needed for the following so Infracost gets notified of repo or pull request changes and can process the code:
  - Contents (Repository contents, commits, branches, downloads, releases, and merges)
  - Metadata (Search repositories, list collaborators, and access repository metadata)
  - Custom properties (repo and org custom properties values)
  - Merge queues
  - Actions (Workflows, workflow runs and artifacts)
  - Deployments (Deployments and deployment statuses)
  - Package (Packages published to GitHub package platform, e.g. AWS CDK constructs)
  - Issues (Issues and related comments, assignees, labels, and milestones)
  - Administration (Repository creation, deletion, settings, teams, and collaborators)
  - Members (Organization members and teams)
- **Read and write** access is needed for the following so Infracost can post pull request comments and update statuses in GitHub:
  - Pull requests (Pull requests and related comments, assignees, labels, milestones, and merges)
  - Checks (checks on code)
  - Commit statuses
  - Webhooks (Manage the post-receive hooks for a repository)

Email support@infracost.io if you have any questions about GitHub App permissions.

Each time a pull request is opened or a new commit is pushed to an open pull request, the Infracost GitHub App shows the any tagging or FinOps policies issues that were introduced by the by the pull request along with the cost difference between the most recent commit of the pull request branch and the merge base of the base branch. This mirrors GitHub's pull request diff logic and shows only the changes the pull request introduces.

The GitHub App automatically reflects the following changes in Infracost:
- Repos that are **renamed** are automatically updated in Infracost.
- When a repo is **moved** from one GitHub Org to another, that change is reflected in Infracost. When the source and destination GitHub Orgs are in different Infracost Orgs, the move is also performed as long as the Infracost Cloud orgs are in the same Enterprise.
- Repos that are **deleted** or **archived** are marked as archived in Infracost and preserved for audit purposes. Their issues no longer show in the dashboard.

### Disable pull request comments

From the Org Settings > Integrations > GitHub App page, you can disable pull request comments so cost estimates, guardrails and tagging policies are only shown in Infracost Cloud. This enables you to test these features without impacting engineering workflows.

### Dismiss or snooze policy issues

Infracost FinOps and Tagging issues can be dismissed or snoozed directly from the GitHub pull request UI, even if the policy required engineers to fix it. This allows engineers to ship critical changes without having to fix all issues. During non-emergency circumstances, we recommend engineers to fix the issues they can, and dismiss/snooze any that they cannot fix.

Engineers can add a pull request comment `@infracost help` to get more information on how to dismiss/snooze the issues.

### GitHub Actions to App migration

1. Follow the [usage](#usage) docs to install the app. You can do this from the same Infracost organization you use already, and going into the Org Settings > Integrations page.
2. Test it by [sending a pull request](/docs/infracost_cloud/get_started/#4-send-a-pull-request).
3. Remove all Infracost steps from your GitHub Actions.

## Make Infracost a required check

When you mark a policy as "Require engineers to resolve or dismiss issues", Infracost returns a "failed" status check to GitHub for pull requests that fail that policy. However, this does not, by itself, block the merge button in GitHub. To do that, you need to mark Infracost as "Required Check" in GitHub. There are two options for this:

1. **Recommended**: Create a GitHub Ruleset to make Infracost a required status check across all of your repos in your GitHub organization. In GitHub, go to Settings > Repository > Rulsets and create a new ruleset with details from [**this screenshot**](pathname:///docs/img/infracost-cloud/github-app/ruleset-required-check.png). Use "Infracost" (with the capital I) when adding the check.
You can read more about Rulesets in the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-rulesets/about-rulesets); [this docs section](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-rulesets/about-rulesets#about-rule-layering) describes how rulesets interact at the organization and repo level.
2. Branch protection rules can also be used, though that works on a per-repo basis so you will need to use the GitHub API to automate that for all of your repos. In GitHub, go to Settings > Branches > and tick the "Require status checks to pass before merging" option under Protect matching branches, as shown in [this screenshot](pathname:///docs/img/infracost-cloud/github-app/bpr-required-check.png).

Note that when engineers [dismiss or snooze](#dismiss-or-snooze-blocking-policy-issues) pull requests, Infracost returns a "passed" status check to GitHub and unblocks the pull requests. Infracost automatically returns the "skipped" status check when a repo does not have any Terraform.

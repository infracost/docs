Infracost CI/CD integrations can be used to automatically add a pull request comment showing the diff of monthly costs between the current and planned state. Minor cost increase/decrease changes can be ignored by setting a threshold for the comment to be added.

## Docker images

Infracost can be used in any CI/CD system using our CI [Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/infracost/infracost/tags):
- `infracost/infracost:ci-0.9` - **Recommended**. Use the latest 0.9.x version to pick up bug fixes and new resource costs.
- `infracost/infracost:ci-0.9.15` - Lock the version.
- `infracost/infracost:ci-latest` - Use the latest Infracost image. This might break when new minor or major versions are released.

The images contain the Infracost [CLI binary](https://github.com/infracost/infracost), [Compost](https://github.com/infracost/compost) and [comment.sh](https://github.com/infracost/infracost/blob/master/scripts/ci/comment.sh). Our [GitLab CI](https://gitlab.com/infracost/infracost-gitlab-ci) examples demonstrate how these components can be used in a composable way to post pull request comments in any CI/CD system.

## CircleCI

See the [Infracost CircleCI Orb](https://github.com/infracost/infracost-orb) for instructions and a demo of using it with GitHub and Bitbucket.

## Slack

All of the above CI/CD integrations support also posting the pull request comment to a Slack channel. To enable it, create a [Slack Webhook](https://slack.com/intl/en-tr/help/articles/115005265063-Incoming-webhooks-for-Slack) and set its value to the `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` environment variable.

## My CI/CD isn't supported

Please [create an issue](https://github.com/infracost/infracost/issues/new/choose); we'll try to prioritize it depending on the community feedback. There is already a request for [BuildKite](https://github.com/infracost/infracost/issues/499) and [Codefresh](https://github.com/infracost/infracost/issues/975). Please üëç it if you'd like us to work on them sooner. You can also join our [community Slack channel](https://www.infracost.io/community-chat) if you like to work on an integration, the existing GitLab CI integration can act as a blueprint.

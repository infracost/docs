                <h3>Infrastructure</h3>
                <p>
                  Infracost uses Amazon Web Services to host our applications. We utilize AWS services for Intrusion Detection and Audit Logging and utilize VPCs and Security Groups to isolate our infrastructure.
                  Production environments are separated from development environments.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We use Vanta to continually monitor our AWS configurations are meeting our high security standards.
                </p>
                <h3>Application</h3>
                <p>
                  Infracost uses code analysis and vulnerability scanning tools, including GitHub CodeQL, Dependabot and Snyk.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We implement best practices for our Software Development Lifecycle including continuous integration and deployment, review requests and code branch protection.
                </p>
                <h3>Database</h3>
                <p>
                  All customer data stored by Infracost is encrypted at rest and during transit. All Infracost's databases have regular backups enabled and periodically tested.

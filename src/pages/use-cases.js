                    <p>As organizations scale, it becomes hard to have a single DevOps team managing all the infrastructure requirements of all product teams. Instead, they opt for using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to create a set of easy to use modules which are managed by the central operations/platform team and used by the rest of the organization as and when infrastructure is needed.</p>
                    <p>The problem they face is that the lack of cost visibility and understanding of what infrastructure is about to be launched and its cost implications cause high cloud bills and ballooning budgets.</p>

                        <span>Engineers are shown the estimated cost of infrastructure upfront, before any resources are launched or changed. They can make economical choices while keeping software delivery speeds up.</span>

                        <span>Infracost sits in the workflow (CI/CD) and provides the information needed to make the right decisions. Budgets are not broken and less re-work is required to fix infrastructure to align with budgets post launch.</span>

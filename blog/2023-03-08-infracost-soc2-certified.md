I’m very excited to announce that Infracost has achieved SOC2 Type 2 certification. This is a significant milestone for us as it reinforces our commitment to security, privacy, and reliability.

We understand the importance of maintaining high standards of security and compliance, especially for our enterprise customers who rely on our platform to help them be proactive in managing their cloud infrastructure and their cloud costs vs reactive after money has been spent. Our certification means that our platform can be trusted by our users and customers across our Open Source as well as SaaS product to handle their sensitive data.

To achieve SOC2 Type 2 compliance, we underwent a rigorous audit conducted by a third-party auditing firm. The audit evaluated our internal controls, policies, and procedures, and confirmed that they met the stringent requirements set by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA).

#### What is Infracost:

Infracost CI/CD helps engineers understand how their code changes will impact cloud costs. It does this by sitting in the CI/CD pipeline, and when Infrastructure-as-Code is changed, Infracost leaves a comment like ‘this change will increase your costs by 20% next month’, with a detailed breakdown. This is all done proactively before any resources are launched.

Infracost Cloud sits on top of the CI/CD integration and gives managers, FinOps and Platform teams a central place where they can see all upcoming changes to cloud costs, as well as letting them design guardrails and policies to automate best practices directly in CI/CD.

Infracost can be setup in a matter of minutes; It is open source and free. Get started now:

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

We released usage profiles, a new GitHub App, weekly reports and branch filters. Upgrade to version [v0.10.12](/docs/#1-install-infracost) and log in to [Infracost Cloud](https://dashboard.infracost.io) to see the new features.

Infracost was recognized by Gartner as a Cool Vendor in the Platform Engineering category, and we hit 8,000 GitHub stars 🎉

### Usage profiles

Companies dealing with a large number of services often find it easier to categorize their service usage or traffic into low/medium/high profiles. This enables them to get a rough cost estimate for many services quickly without defining usage values for each individual resource in those services.

To enable this use-case, the [usage file](/docs/features/usage_based_resources/) supports a new [`resource_type_default_usage`](/docs/features/usage_based_resources/#usage-profiles) section that can be used to define usage for a resource type, e.g. `aws_dynamodb_table`. Resource type defaults can be overridden on a per-resource basis. You can create separate files for different traffic profiles, e.g. low/medium/high, to use with the Infracost breakdown or diff's `--usage-file` flag.

### GitHub App

Companies dealing with tens or hundreds of repos find it time consuming to deploy and maintain Infracost across all of their repos. Platform teams at these companies want to integrate with Infracost so all dev teams are aware of the cost implications of their changes.

To help them do this quickly, we've created a new [Infracost GitHub App](/docs/integrations/github_app/) where they can select the repos to enable Infracost on. GitHub notifies Infracost Cloud of new pull requests, Infracost runs on our infrastructure to post pull request comments, and we scale and the maintain the integration. Simple!

| 1. Install the Infracost GitHub App | 2. Get pull request comments |

### Weekly reports

All Infracost Cloud users now get a weekly email of the most impactful pull requests across all repos in their organizations. You can update your email notification preferences from the new [user settings](https://dashboard.infracost.io/user/settings) page.

### Branch and date filters

Pull requests are often merged into various branches on their way to production, such as development, staging and testing. The Infracost Cloud dashboard now supports two new filters:
- **base branch**: useful to filter on one branch, such as development, so you can quickly see the most impactful pull requests that should be reviewed.
- **date range**: useful to filter on a date range where an actual cost spike happened so you can see all of the pull requests that were being worked on at that time (and what repos/users they were from).

### CLI improvements

The CLI supports a [new environment variable](/docs/features/environment_variables/#infracost_currency_format) so you can configure the Infracost output currency format, for example running Infracost with `INFRACOST_CURRENCY=EUR INFRACOST_CURRENCY_FORMAT="EUR: 1.234,56€"` and the total cost "64145.4525" outputs "64.145,45€".

The CLI [JSON output](/docs/features/json_output_format/) now includes HCL warnings in the project metadata section. This enables Infracost Cloud to show you useful information about missing configurations that could be affecting your cost estimates. You can pass-in these variables in a [config file](/docs/features/config_file/) or set the [environment variables](/docs/features/environment_variables/#infracost_terraform_cloud_token) so the CLI can fetch them from Terraform Cloud/GitLab.

### Community content

Infracost hit 8,000 GitHub stars ⭐ and [Gartner](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6985626997427249152/) recognized Infracost as a Cool Vendor in the Platform Engineering category: "Enterprise IT leaders are setting up platform engineering teams to build and operate self-service internal developer platforms for software delivery and life cycle management"...

### Up next

👉 We're looking for early users who want to connect Infracost to their AWS Cost & Usage Reports so they can see usage costs for usage based resources such as S3, Lambda and data transfer in pull request comments too! Email me at [hello@infracost.io](mailto:hello@infracost.io) if you'd like to help.

[Join our community call](https://github.com/infracost/infracost/issues/2085) on Tuesday **11 November** to discuss the above features and the upcoming usage costs feature!

We released Infracost v0.9.7 recently, you can [upgrade](/docs/#1-install-infracost) to use these features.

<!--truncate-->

### Currency conversion

You can now use `infracost configure set currency` to set your preferred currency (e.g. EUR, BRL or INR). Any [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217#Active_codes) currency code should work, for example use XAG to see how much Silver you're spending on the cloud ðŸ˜‚ The environment variable `INFRACOST_CURRENCY` can be used to set the currency in CI/CD pipelines. Cloud vendors usually publish prices in USD so the costs will be converted from USD to your preferred currency using the current exchange rate when the CLI is run.

The new `infracost configure` command can also be used to get/set your API key, and for users who are self-hosting the Cloud Pricing API, setting your API Endpoint.

### Improved Terragrunt support

We have spent a lot of time improving our support for Terragrunt, and we'd love for you to try this out and give us more feedback on how to improve it further. Previously, Terragrunt users had to set `INFRACOST_TERRAFORM_BINARY` and specify their Terragrunt modules in the Infracost config file manually. These steps are no longer needed as Terragrunt projects are now automatically detected when passed in via the `--path` flag. You can read more about this initial set of improvements for Terragrunt in [our docs](/docs/features/terragrunt). Please open a GitHub issue with feedback and suggestions.

### Slack integration

We have always focused on making it easy to see costs within your workflow. For some companies, Slack is part of their workflow and communication flow. With that, [Slack integration](/docs/integrations/cicd#slack) is now supported by all of our CI/CD integrations so pull request comments can also be posted to a Slack channel.

### A few more improvements

- When running `infracost breakdown` and `infracost output`, you can now use `--fields all` to output all available fields in the table or HTML output. The JSON format always includes all fields.
- We've added support for the following Azure Terraform resources: `azurerm_active_directory_domain_service`, `azurerm_virtual_network_gateway` and `azurerm_private_endpoint`.

### Up next!

We're prototyping how we can populate the [usage file](/docs/features/usage_based_resources) with data from AWS CloudWatch for resources like `aws_s3_bucket` or `aws_lambda_function`. We'd love to hear your feedback via [this issue](https://github.com/infracost/infracost/issues/730).

We're glad to see our community growing; it's been awesome to hear your feedback on features and discuss how you're handling cloud costs as part of your workflows. Message me on [Slack](https://www.infracost.io/community-chat) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/alikhajeh) if you have any questions!

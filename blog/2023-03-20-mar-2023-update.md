We're excited to announce that we're making the Infracost GitHub App free for everyone so you can put cost estimates everywhere quickly ðŸŽ‰ We also passed our SOC2 Type 2 audit, added support for wildcards in the usage file, and redesigned the cost estimate page.

<!--truncate-->

Log in to [Infracost Cloud](https://dashboard.infracost.io) or upgrade to CLI version [v0.10.18](/docs/#1-install-infracost) to use the new features.

## Free GitHub App integration

We think regardless of you buying a tshirt or an EC2 instance, you should know the costs **before** you buy it. Without this basic need, engineers don't see costs for the thousands of cloud resources they "buy" with their infrastructure-as-code workflow. And no one really understands the cost implications until it is too late. Usually this continues for months, and cloud costs keep increasing until the budget is blown. That's bad for two reasons:
1. The money has already been spent - and it's not coming back.
2. Engineers now need to burn more time to go back and fix issues.

So today we're excited to announce that we're making the Infracost GitHub App free for everyone so you can put cost estimates everywhere quickly ðŸŽ‰ [Set this up now from Infracost Cloud](https://dashboard.infracost.io).

There are two key benefits of using the GitHub App over manual CI/CD integrations:
1. You can add Infracost to multiple repos with one click, no need to install or update CLI versions in your CI/CD pipeline.
2. Infracost runs significantly faster as only changed folders are run based on the GitHub App events.

## SOC2 Type II

I'm excited to announce that Infracost has achieved SOC2 Type 2 certification. This is a significant milestone for us as it reinforces our commitment to security, privacy, and reliability. Please [contact us](mailto:hello@infracost.io) if you'd like to request the audit report.

To achieve SOC2 Type 2 compliance, we underwent a rigorous audit conducted by a third-party auditing firm. The audit evaluated our internal controls, policies, and procedures, and confirmed that they met the stringent requirements set by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA).

## Usage file wildcards

The [usage file](/docs/features/usage_based_resources/) enables you to specify resource usage and get cost estimates for usage based resources such as AWS S3 or Lambda. This file now supports the use of the wildcard character `[*]` for resource arrays (resources with [`count` meta-argument](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/meta-arguments/count.html)) and resource maps (resources with [`for_each` meta-argument](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/meta-arguments/for_each.html)). 

```yaml
version: 0.1
resource_usage:
  mod.my_module[*].aws_cloudwatch_log_group.my_group[*]:
    storage_gb: 1000
    monthly_data_ingested_gb: 50
```

## Cost estimate page

We've redesigned the cost estimate page to simplify it. We've also made it easy to see details of cost changes or breakdowns of each project in the pull request. For users that use the [GitHub App integration](/docs/integrations/github_app/), this page also shows an audit trail of the approver, the person who merged it and any labels associated with the pull request. This enables people outside the engineering team, such as FinOps teams, to have full context of the change and know who to speak to for more information.

## Microsoft Teams integration

[Guardrails](/docs/infracost_cloud/guardrails/) help you control costs by monitoring pull requests and triggering actions when your defined thresholds or budgets are exceeded. Previously guardrails supported email and Slack notifications. We recently added support for Microsoft Teams to this feature too.

## Other improvements

We also released the following improvements:
- Added support and fixed bugs in the following cloud resources:
  - **AWS**: Lambda provisioned concurrency and related ephemeral storage, Glue Job.
  - **Azure**: PowerBI Embedded, MSSQL Elastic Pool, and around 50 free resources.
- Ignore parent `terragrunt.hcl` files in a Terragrunt directory and use top level `.infracost` directory for the cache.
- Improved [troubleshooting](/docs/cloud_pricing_api/self_hosted/#troubleshooting) for self-hosted Cloud Pricing API, and removed the feedback link in pull request comments.
- Support for project-level Jira admins in [Jira integration](/docs/infracost_cloud/jira_integration/).
- Removed the early exit in the CLI if all projects have errored, so the output will be generated correctly even if all projects have errored. This change also removes the output table from the pull request comment if there are no projects in the output JSON.

## Community content

Many thanks to first time contributors [@lyonsden](https://github.com/lyonsden) and [@infowolfe](https://github.com/infowolfe) - [InfraSocks](https://twitter.com/AliKhajeh/status/1510310791508946945) are coming your way! Also shout-out to the following people for sharing their knowledge with the rest of the community:
- [George Vagenas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgevagenas): [Infracost and Terraform: Giving Developers the Tools to Manage Cloud Costs](https://devrealm.org/infracost-and-terraform-giving-developers-the-tools-to-manage-cloud-costs)
- [Guhan Sundar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guhansun/): [Engineering: Integrating Infracost for Cost Visibility](https://www.argonaut.dev/blog/infracost-cost-visibility)

Finally thought: you can't reduce your cloud costs directly! You have two levers to play with: usage and unit price. Usage is owned by Engineering and is decentralized across teams; Unit price is owned by FinOps and centralized - [Hassan's new blog](/blog/cloud-cost-optimization-formula/) explains more.

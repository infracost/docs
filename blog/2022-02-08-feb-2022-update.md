Infracost [v0.9.17](https://www.infracost.io/docs/#1-install-infracost) is live! There's a new Atlantis integration, native Azure DevOps extension, cost policies with Open Policy Agent, Sentinel and more.

<!--truncate-->

## New Atlantis integration

The new [Infracost Atlantis integration](https://github.com/infracost/infracost-atlantis/) enables you to:
1. Post separate pull request comments instead of having the Infracost output at the bottom of the Atlantis output. This was the number one feedback we received from Atlantis users so we rolled-up our sleeves and contributed to the Atlantis project to enable this by adding a [post workflow hook](https://www.runatlantis.io/docs/post-workflow-hooks.html).
2. Upgrade Infracost independently of Atlantis by using [Docker images](https://github.com/infracost/infracost-atlantis/#a-use-our-docker-images-recommended) that we'll maintain.
3. Added [an option](https://github.com/infracost/infracost-atlantis/#c-install-in-pre-workflow-good-for-testing) to install Infracost into an existing Atlantis deployment without changing the Docker image, which is good for testing.

Follow our [migration guide](/docs/guides/atlantis_migration/) if you used the old bash-based integration.

## New Azure DevOps extension

The new [Infracost Azure DevOps extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Infracost.infracost-tasks) is live in the Azure Marketplace! These JavaScript tasks offer a composable way of using Infracost in your pipeline. We've also added an Azure Repos output format, a cost summary table, and different behaviors, so you can control when comments are posted.

Follow our [migration guide](/docs/guides/azure_devops_migration/) if you used the old bash-based integration.

## Cost policies

We [launched](/blog/cloud-cost-policies/) our new integration between Infracost and Open Policy Agent (OPA), HashiCorp Sentinel and Conftest. This enables DevOps teams to set policies on cost estimates before resources are launched. You can write custom policies to provide guardrails and ask a team lead to review changes that, for example, result in provisioned IOPS to cost more than instances.

The launch also hit the first page of Hacker News! Read [the docs](/docs/features/cost_policies/) to get started with cost policies.

## Infracost `comment` command

We released a new `infracost comment` command that can post cost estimates to GitHub, GitLab and Azure Repos (previously we had been using bash in our CI/CD integrations). Both cloud and enterprise/self-hosted versions of these version control systems are supported. Bitbucket support is coming soon, üëç [this issue](https://github.com/infracost/infracost/issues/1173) for updates.

Checkout the [CLI docs](/docs/features/cli_commands/#comment-on-pull-requests) to learn more.

## New use cases page

We spoke with many users to learn about how they use Infracost. We documented the three [common use cases](https://www.infracost.io/use-cases/) that emerged so you can learn too:
- Cost visibility for self-service infrastructure
- Proactive cloud cost policies
- Consultants helping clients adopt and scale on cloud

## Community buzz

We hit 5000 GitHub stars! We [celebrated](https://twitter.com/AliKhajeh/status/1491130133390196737) by randomly picking 10 people who starred the Infracost repo to send [InfraSocks](https://twitter.com/PeterDaveHello/status/1490679046673690625) to.

Shout-out to:
- Sina Bakhtiari for helping migrate resources to a new coding structure, this'll enable interesting use-cases in the future.

- ReportWire who wrote an [article](http://reportwire.org/2022/01/18/how-to-get-started-with-infracost/) on how to get started with Infracost.
- Kanishk Agrawal who wrote [a blog](https://blog.clairvoyantsoft.com/terraform-pull-request-automation-using-atlantis-and-infracost-864d7a89fd45) on how to setup Azure DevOps + Atlantis + Infracost.
- Anton Babenko who keeps doing awesome work in the open source community; we couldn't resist [sponsoring](https://twitter.com/infracost/status/1486683529845088256) him again.

Finally, after traveling around the world for 5 years, I moved back to the US! Our team is now distributed between the US west coast (me), US east coast (Tim), UK (Alistair and Hugo), Portugal (Hassan) and Germany (Vadim). This remote setup works great as we have open source contributors and users that are spread all over the world.

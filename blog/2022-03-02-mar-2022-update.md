Infracost [v0.9.19](https://www.infracost.io/docs/#1-install-infracost) is live! We experimented with parsing HCL, partnered with GitLab, improved Bitbucket support, published a Windows Chocolatey package, and added many new resources...

## Parsing HCL

Imagine you could add Infracost to [repo README files](https://github.com/infracost/infracost/issues/43), get cost estimates for Terraform modules **before** using them in your projects, and even see cost estimates in Visual Studio 🤯 

That's why in February we started experimenting with parsing HCL directly, without relying on the Terraform binary, a plan JSON file or cloud credentials. Can you tell we have an [unhealthy obsession with cloud costs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lefCU2ptsio)?

We need your help to make this experiment work! Please run this new method using the following command, compare the output with the existing method, and create [GitHub issues](https://github.com/infracost/infracost/issues) if you find discrepancies so we can investigate them:

  ```shell
  infracost breakdown --path=path/to/code --terraform-parse-hcl \
    --terraform-var-file="myvars.tfvars" \ # Load variables from provided files, similar to Terraform's -var-file flag
    --terraform-var "my_var=value" \       # Set a value for one of the input variables, similar to Terraform's -var flag
    --terraform-var "my_other_var=value"   # The --terraform-var-file and --terraform-var flags can be used multiple times
  ```

## GitLab partnership

We love GitLab and have officially partnered with them to bring Infracost to all GitLab users! You can find us under [Continuous Integration](https://about.gitlab.com/partners/technology-partners/#continuous-integration) on their partners page. You can also find GitLab on our new [CI/CD landing page](https://infracost.io/cicd/).

## Bitbucket Cloud/Server

The new `infracost comment bitbucket` command can be used to post cost estimates to pull requests in Bitbucket Cloud or Server; see [our docs](/docs/features/cli_commands/#bitbucket) for details. The `infracost output` [command](/docs/features/cli_commands/#combined-output-formats) also supports generating Bitbucket-compatible markdown for users that prefer to post the comment manually (e.g. with curl).

## Release binaries

Windows users can now install Infracost using [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) with `choco install infracost`, or download our new [Zip files](https://github.com/infracost/infracost/releases) that contain infracost.exe. We've also released ARM64 binaries for MacOS, Linux and Windows.

Going forward, all of our releases come with SHA256 checksums that are verified by Homebrew, Chocolatey and our installer script.

## New resources

We added support for the following new [cloud resources](/docs/supported_resources/overview/) and identified 17 more free Terraform resources, bringing our total to 230 paid and over 550 free resources 🚀

- AWS:
  - T4g instances (ARM-based AWS Graviton2 processors) for EC2, RDS and Neptune
  - App Autoscaling support with DynamoDB, ElastiCache, Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (MSK)
  - RDS Performance Insights
  - S3 Bucket Lifecycle Configuration
- Azure: Premium Event Hubs and Log Analytics Workspaces

## Community call

A huge thank you to everyone who reported issues and gave us feedback last month, specially Curtis Wahlfeld and Rob Lazzurs for sending pull requests to improve the Infracost-Bitbucket integration, and Guillaume Vincent for writing a [blog](https://betterprogramming.pub/5-essential-terraform-tools-to-use-everyday-e910a96e70d9) on 5 Essential Terraform Tools To Use Everyday. [InfraSocks](https://twitter.com/PeterDaveHello/status/1490679046673690625) are coming your way!

[Join our community call](https://github.com/infracost/infracost/issues/1425) on Wednesday 9 March to discuss any topics related to Infracost and cloud costs. We'll also share the latest product news.

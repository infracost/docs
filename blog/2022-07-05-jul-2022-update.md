We released the Infracost VSCode extension, which was so popular that it hit the front page of Hacker News. That pushed Infracost to over 7,000 GitHub stars ⭐

We also released [v0.10.6](/docs/#1-install-infracost) that lets you customize project names, and exclude paths when running with large repos.

## VSCode extension

The Infracost VSCode extension shows cost estimates for Terraform right in your editor. You can shift cloud costs all the way left and get immediate feedback as you develop infra-as-code.

This helps with a few use-cases:
- **Compare configs, instance types, regions etc**: copy/paste a code block, make changes and compare them.
- **Quick cost estimate**: write a code block and get a cost estimate without having to use AWS, Google or Azure cost calculators, or read the long/complicated pricing web pages.
- **Catch costly typos**: if you accidentally type 22 instead of 2 as the instance count, or 1000GB volume size instead of 100, the cost estimate will immediately pick that up and let you know.

The extension got a lot of love from the community. Get started here: [Infracost VSCode Extension](https://github.com/infracost/vscode-infracost/)

## Customize project names

Infracost auto-generates project names based on the user-provided path or git repo name. The name appears in the CLI output and pull request comments. With this release, you can now define your own custom project name.

The main use-case is when a path such as `/tmp/plan.json` is used, the name can become long and hard to understand. This feature lets you set the name to something more understandable.

The `infracost breakdown` and `diff` commands now [support](/docs/features/cli_commands/#project-names) a new `--project-name` flag that enables this:

## Exclude paths

When using Infracost in a multi-project environment or with Terragrunt, where you want to exclude paths that are in a broken state, you can use the `infracost breakdown` and `diff` commands with the `--exclude-path` flag to ignore directories.

## Terragrunt support

Thanks to the Terragrunt user community for working with us to fix a number of issues with parsing HCL:
- Resolved several issues when evaluating Terragrunt dependency blocks.
- Fixed an issue where nested module blocks in HCL that used inputs from module outputs received a nil value.
- Set env vars on Terragrunt run options, which enables `get_env` function to work correctly.

If you're still having issues after [upgrading](/docs/#1-install-infracost), try [our workarounds](https://github.com/infracost/infracost/issues/1695).

## JSON format updates

We added git and version control metadata to the Infracost [JSON output](/docs/features/cli_commands/#examples). This will be used by [Infracost Cloud](/pricing) to so team leads and FinOps get visibility across all changes, and see pull requests that increase/decrease costs the most. Email hello@infracost.io for early access.

## New resources

We added support for `AWSGlobalAccelerator` and reserved instances for ElastiCache. If you'd like to contribute code to Infracost, [adding resources](https://github.com/infracost/infracost/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22new+resources%22) is a good place to start.

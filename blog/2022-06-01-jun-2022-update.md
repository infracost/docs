Back in February, we started an ambitious journey: remove our dependency on the Terraform CLI by parsing code directly! We're excited to announce Infracost v0.10, which completes that journey 🎉

Infracost is now much faster, simpler to add to CI/CD, and does not need cloud creds since a plan is not required.

<!--truncate-->

## Infracost v0.10

Checkout the [**migration guide**](/docs/guides/v0.10_migration/#migrations-guides) to upgrade. The experimental `--terraform-parse-hcl` flag has been removed and going forward, Infracost can be run in two ways via `--path`:
1. **Parsing HCL code (directory)**: the default and recommended option as it has the following 5 benefits.
    ```shell
    # Terraform variables can be set using --terraform-var-file
    # or --terraform-var
    infracost breakdown --path /code
    ```
2. **Parsing plan JSON file**: this will continue to work as before.
    ```shell
    cd /code
    terraform init
    terraform plan -out tfplan.binary
    terraform show -json tfplan.binary > plan.json

    infracost breakdown --path plan.json
    ```

### 1. Faster CLI

Removing the need for `terraform init` and `terraform plan` means a super-fast CLI: Infracost used to take around 50 seconds to run on our internal Terraform mono-repo, that's now reduced to 2 seconds 🚀

### 2. No cloud creds needed

Removing our dependency on the Terraform binary means you no longer need to set cloud credentials or Terraform secrets, which simplifies CI/CD integrations too.

### 3. Cost of TF modules

Not needing cloud creds/secrets or a Terraform plan means you can now generate cost estimates from [Terraform modules](/docs/features/terraform_modules/). It also enables cost estimates to be put in Infra-as-Code [repo readmes](https://github.com/infracost/infracost/issues/43) and [Visual Studio](https://github.com/infracost/infracost/issues/1546)!

To make `infracost diff` work without a plan, we introduced a new `--compare-to` flag so git-based cost diffs can be produced:
```shell
git checkout main
infracost breakdown --path /code --format json \
    --out-file infracost-base.json

git checkout my-branch
infracost diff --path /code --compare-to infracost-base.json
```

### 4. Compare Infracost runs

The `infracost diff` command can now also be used to compare Infracost runs to see what's changed between historic runs:

```shell
infracost diff --path infracost-today.json \
    --compare-to infracost-last-week.json
```

### 5. Detect multi-project repos

Setting the `--path` flag to a top-level repo directory will now attempt to process all projects [automatically](/docs/guides/v0.10_migration/#5-detect-multi-project-repos). If this does not work for your use-case, use a [config-file](/docs/features/config_file/).

## New resources

We added support for the following [cloud resources](/docs/supported_resources/overview/) and identified many more free resources:

- AWS: Support for reservation in `db_instance`
- Google: `google_compute_per_instance_config`, `google_compute_region_per_instance_config`
